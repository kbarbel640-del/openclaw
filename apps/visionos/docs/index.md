## Focus of this increment

This increment locks the MVP around voice-first communication with OpenClaw and natural gesture controls in Shared Space:

- Continuous duplex voice by default.
- Automatic fallback to push-to-talk during degraded conditions.
- Pinch-first gestures with explicit button fallback.
