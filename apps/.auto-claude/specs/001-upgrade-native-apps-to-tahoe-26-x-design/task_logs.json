Here's my analysis:\n\n## Complexity Assessment Summary\n\n**Complexity: COMPLEX**\n\n**Reasoning:** This is a major UI overhaul task that affects:\n- **2 native platforms** (macOS + iOS)\n- **100+ Swift files** on macOS alone, plus 60+ on iOS\n- **Cross-cutting changes** affecting all UI components (screens, layouts, panels, buttons)\n- Requires implementing Apple's new \"liquid glass of Tahoe\" design system (glassmorphism for macOS/iOS 26.x)\n- Must maintain backward compatibility with earlier versions\n\n### Key Findings:\n\n| Dimension | Assessment |\n|-----------|------------|\n| **Estimated Files** | ~150 files across both platforms |\n| **Services** | 2 (macOS + iOS native apps) |\n| **External Integrations** | None required |\n| **Research Needed** | Yes - new Apple design system |\n| **Infrastructure Changes** | Minimal (version config only) |\n| **Risk Level** | High |\n\n### Recommended Phases:\n1. **discovery** - Explore current UI patterns\n2. **requirements** - Define design requirements\n3. **research** - Research \"liquid glass of Tahoe\" design system\n4. **context** - Understand existing codebase patterns\n5. **spec_writing** - Create detailed specification\n6. **self_critique** - Review and refine approach\n7. **planning** - Plan implementation\n8. **validation** - Test the implementation\n\n### Validation Recommendations:\n- **Test Types:** Unit + Integration + E2E tests\n- **Security Scan:** Not required (design changes)\n- **Staging Deployment:** Required to verify design on both platforms\n\nThe `complexity_assessment.json` has been created at:\n`/Users/jkneen/Documents/GitHub/atomicbot/apps/.auto-claude/specs/001-upgrade-native-apps-to-tahoe-26-x-design/complexity_assessment.json`",

for floating panels\n   118→- Use `.contentBackground` material for main content areas\n   119→- Set `blendingMode = .behindWindow` for translucent backgrounds\n   120→- State should be `.active` for interactive elements, `.inactive` for non-interactive\n   121→\n   122→### Blur Effect (iOS)\n   123→\n   124→From Apple's UIVisualEffectView documentation:\n   125→\n   126→```swift\n   127→//

Points:**\n   133→- Use `.systemThickMaterial` for prominent glass effects\n   134→- Use `.systemMaterial` for standard content backgrounds\n   135→- Use `.systemUltraThinMaterial` for subtle overlays\n   136→- Apply to entire view backgrounds, not individual elements\n   137→\n   138→### SF Symbols Iconography\n   139→\n   140→```swift\n   141→// Consistent icon usage across platforms\n

Points:**\n   148→- Use SF Symbols exclusively for all icons\n   149→- Prefer filled variants for selected states\n   150→- Maintain consistent point sizes (17pt for body, 22pt for navigation)\n   151→\n   152→## Requirements\n   153→\n   154→### Functional Requirements\n   155→\n   156→1. **Liquid Glass Design Implementation**\n   157→   - Description: Implement Apple's glassmorphism design across all UI components using NSVisualEffectView (macOS) and UIVisualEffectView (iOS)\n   158→   - Acceptance: All windows, panels, and floating elements display translucent glass effect with blur\n   159→\n   160→2. **Version 26.x Support**\n   161→   - Description: Ensure all UI components support version 26.x feature requirements including new material styles and animations\n   162→   - Acceptance: App builds and runs correctly with 26.x SDK, all new visual features functional\n   163→\n   164→3. **Backward Compatibility**\n   165→   - Description: Maintain compatibility with earlier macOS (12+) and iOS (15+) versions\n   166→   - Acceptance: UI renders correctly on minimum supported OS versions, graceful degradation for unavailable features\n   167→\n   168→4. **Design Guide Documentation**\n   169→   - Description: Create comprehensive design guide covering all UI components, patterns, and usage instructions\n   170→   - Acceptance: Document exists at `docs/design-guide.md` with all screens, layouts, panels, buttons, and components documented\n   171→\n   172→5. **Cross-Platform Consistency**\n   173→   - Description: Ensure visual consistency between macOS and iOS while respecting platform conventions\n   174→   - Acceptance: Similar screens look related but follow各自 platform's HIG\n   175→\n   176→### Edge Cases\n   177→\n   178→1. **Performance on Older Hardware** - Implement fallback to reduced blur effects on systems without GPU acceleration\n   179→2. **High Contrast Mode** - Ensure accessibility by providing high contrast alternatives when system preference is enabled\n   180→3. **Dark/Light Mode** - Support both appearance modes with appropriate material selections\n   181→4. **Reduced Motion** - Disable or reduce animations when system reduced motion preference is enabled\n   182→5. **Notch/Dynamic Island** - Properly handle safe area insets and display cutouts on notched devices\n   183→\n   184→## Implementation Notes\n   185→\n   186→### DO\n   187→- Use SwiftUI for new UI components as it provides better cross-platform compatibility\n   188→- Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for platform-specific behaviors\n   189→- Test on actual devices/simulators with minimum supported OS versions\n   190→- Use version checks to conditionally enable 26.x-only features\n   191→- Document all new components in the design guide\n   192→\n   193→### DON'T\n   194→- Create custom blur implementations when native visual effect views are available\n   195→- Mix AppKit and SwiftUI inappropriately - prefer SwiftUI for new components\n   196→- Use hardcoded colors - always use semantic colors from the design system\n   197→- Skip accessibility testing - glassmorphism can affect readability\n   198→\n   199→## Development Environment\n   200→\n   201→### Prerequisites\n   202→- Xcode 15.0+\n   203→- macOS 14.0+ (for development)\n   204→- iOS 16.0+ Simulator\n   205→- Swift

A formal design guide must be established to ensure consistency across the native applications.\n11:**Rationale**: This is a major feature implementation involving a complete UI redesign across two platforms. It introduces new visual design elements (glassmorphism, blur effects), creates new design documentation, and requires architectural changes to support both the new 26.x design system and backward compatibility with earlier versions.\n21:- [ ] Add support for version 26.x feature requirements\n160:2. **Version 26.x Support**\n161:   - Description: Ensure all UI components support version 26.x feature requirements including new material styles and animations\n162:   - Acceptance: App builds and runs correctly with 26.x SDK, all new visual features functional\n190:- Use version checks to conditionally enable 26.x-only features\n228:3.

The upgrade requires a comprehensive UI overhaul affecting all screens, layouts, panels, buttons, and UI components across both platforms. A formal design guide must be established to ensure consistency across the native applications.\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This is a major feature implementation involving a complete UI redesign across two platforms. It introduces new visual design elements (glassmorphism, blur effects), creates new design documentation, and requires architectural changes to support both the new 26.x design system and backward compatibility with earlier versions.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **macOS App** (primary) - Native AppKit/SwiftUI application requiring glassmorphism design implementation\n    17→- **iOS App** (primary) - Native UIKit/SwiftUI application requiring blur effects and visual consistency\n    18→\n    19→### This Task Will:\n    20→- [ ] Implement \"liquid glass of Tahoe\" glassmorphism design system across all UI components\n    21→- [ ] Add support for version 26.x feature requirements\n    22→- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with earlier macOS/iOS versions\n    23→- [ ] Establish a comprehensive design guide for screens, layouts, panels, buttons, and UI components\n    24→- [ ] Apply consistent visual design across both macOS and iOS platforms\n    25→- [ ] Ensure native apps (NOT Electron) comply with new design consistency requirements\n    26→\n    27→### Out of Scope:\n    28→- Electron/web application changes\n    29→- Backend API modifications\n    30→- Database schema changes\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

The upgrade requires a comprehensive UI overhaul affecting all screens, layouts, panels, buttons, and UI components across both platforms. A formal design guide must be established to ensure consistency across the native applications.\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This is a major feature implementation involving a complete UI redesign across two platforms. It introduces new visual design elements (glassmorphism, blur effects), creates new design documentation, and requires architectural changes to support both the new 26.x design system and backward compatibility with earlier versions.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **macOS App** (primary) - Native AppKit/SwiftUI application requiring glassmorphism design implementation\n    17→- **iOS App** (primary) - Native UIKit/SwiftUI application requiring blur effects and visual consistency\n    18→\n    19→### This Task Will:\n    20→- [ ] Implement \"liquid glass of Tahoe\" glassmorphism design system across all UI components\n    21→- [ ] Add support for version 26.x feature requirements\n    22→- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with earlier macOS/iOS versions\n    23→- [ ] Establish a comprehensive design guide for screens, layouts, panels, buttons, and UI components\n    24→- [ ] Apply consistent visual design across both macOS and iOS platforms\n    25→- [ ] Ensure native apps (NOT Electron) comply with new design consistency requirements\n    26→\n    27→### Out of Scope:\n    28→- Electron/web application changes\n    29→- Backend API modifications\n    30→- Database schema changes\n    31→- New feature functionality (UI-only changes)\n    32→\n    33→## Service Context\n    34→\n    35→### macOS Application\n    36→\n    37→**Tech Stack:**\n    38→- Language: Swift\n    39→- Framework: AppKit/SwiftUI\n    40→- Key directories: `macos/Sources/OpenClaw/` (100+ Swift source files)\n    41→\n    42→**Entry Point**: `macos/Sources/OpenClaw/` (main app bundle)\n    43→\n    44→**How to Run:**\n    45→```bash\n    46→# Open in Xcode\n    47→open macos/OpenClaw.xcodeproj\n    48→# Or build via command line\n    49→xcodebuild -project macos/OpenClaw.xcodeproj -scheme OpenClaw -configuration Debug build\n    50→```\n    51→\n    52→**Port**: N/A (native macOS app)\n    53→\n    54→### iOS Application\n    55→\n    56→**Tech Stack:**\n    57→- Language: Swift\n    58→- Framework: UIKit/SwiftUI\n    59→- Key directories: `ios/Sources/` (60+ Swift source files)\n    60→\n    61→**Entry Point**: `ios/Sources/OpenClawApp.swift`\n    62→\n    63→**How to Run:**\n    64→```bash\n    65→# Open in Xcode\n    66→open ios/OpenClaw.xcodeproj\n    67→# Or build for simulator\n    68→xcodebuild -project ios/OpenClaw.xcodeproj -scheme OpenClaw -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator'\n    69→```\n    70→\n    71→**Port**: N/A (native iOS app)\n    72→\n    73→## Files to Modify\n    74→\n    75→| File | Service | What to Change |\n    76→|------|---------|---------------|\n    77→| `macos/Sources/OpenClaw/**/*.swift` | macOS | Apply glassmorphism (NSVisualEffectView) to UI components |\n    78→| `ios/Sources/**/*.swift` | iOS | Apply blur effects (UIVisualEffectView) to UI components |\n    79→| `macos/Sources/OpenClaw/CanvasWindow.swift` | macOS | Implement glass panel design |\n    80→| `macos/Sources/OpenClaw/ChannelsSettings+View.swift` | macOS | Apply design system to settings panels |\n    81→| `ios/Sources/Settings/*.swift` | iOS | Apply design system to settings views |\n    82→| `macos/Sources/OpenClaw/*Settings*.swift` | macOS | Update all settings views with new design |\n    83→| `ios/Sources/*/*.swift` | iOS | Update all UI views with new design |\n    84→| **[Design Guide]** | Both | Create new `docs/design-guide.md` documenting all UI patterns |\n    85→\n    86→**Note**: Specific files will be identified during implementation via UI component audit.\n    87→\n    88→## Files to Reference\n    89→\n    90→These files provide patterns to follow:\n    91→\n    92→| File | Pattern to Copy |\n    93→|------|----------------|\n    94→| `macos/Sources/OpenClaw/CanvasWindow.swift` | Window/container structure for glassmorphism |\n    95→| `macos/Sources/OpenClaw/ContextMenuCardView.swift` | Card/popup UI component styling |\n    96→| `ios/Sources/Status/StatusPill.swift` | Status indicator component design |\n    97→| `ios/Sources/Status/VoiceWakeToast.swift` | Toast/notification component design |\n    98→| Apple Documentation: NSVisualEffectView | macOS glassmorphism implementation |\n    99→| Apple Documentation: UIVisualEffectView | iOS blur effect implementation |\n   100→| Apple Human Interface Guidelines | Platform-specific design patterns |\n   101→\n   102→## Patterns to Follow\n   103→\n   104→### Glassmorphism Effect (macOS)\n   105→\n   106→From Apple's NSVisualEffectView documentation:\n   107→\n   108→```swift\n   109→// Standard glass material implementation\n   110→let visualEffectView = NSVisualEffectView()\n   111→visualEffectView.material = .hudWindow\n   112→visualEffectView.blendingMode = .behindWindow\n   113→visualEffectView.state = .active\n   114→```\n   115→\n   116→**Key Points:**\n   117→- Use `.hudWindow` or `.popover` material for floating panels\n   118→- Use `.contentBackground` material for main content areas\n   119→- Set `blendingMode = .behindWindow` for translucent backgrounds\n   120→- State should be `.active` for interactive elements, `.inactive` for non-interactive\n   121→\n   122→### Blur Effect (iOS)\n   123→\n   124→From Apple's UIVisualEffectView documentation:\n   125→\n   126→```swift\n   127→// Standard blur implementation\n   128→let blurEffect = UIBlurEffect(style: .systemThickMaterial)\n   129→let visualEffectView = UIVisualEffectView(effect: blurEffect)\n   130→```\n   131→\n   132→**Key Points:**\n   133→- Use `.systemThickMaterial` for prominent glass effects\n   134→- Use `.systemMaterial` for standard content backgrounds\n   135→- Use `.systemUltraThinMaterial` for subtle overlays\n   136→- Apply to entire view backgrounds, not individual elements\n   137→\n   138→### SF Symbols Iconography\n   139→\n   140→```swift\n   141→// Consistent icon usage across platforms\n   142→Image(systemName: \"gear\")           // Settings\n   143→Image(systemName: \"house\")          // Home\n   144→Image(systemName: \"person.circle\")  // Profile\n   145→```\n   146→\n   147→**Key Points:**\n   148→- Use SF Symbols exclusively for all icons\n   149→- Prefer filled variants for selected states\n   150→- Maintain consistent point sizes (17pt for body, 22pt for navigation)\n   151→\n   152→## Requirements\n   153→\n   154→### Functional Requirements\n   155→\n   156→1. **Liquid Glass Design Implementation**\n   157→   - Description: Implement Apple's glassmorphism design across all UI components using NSVisualEffectView (macOS) and UIVisualEffectView (iOS)\n   158→   - Acceptance: All windows, panels, and floating elements display translucent glass effect with blur\n   159→\n   160→2. **Version 26.x Support**\n   161→   - Description: Ensure all UI components support version 26.x feature requirements including new material styles and animations\n   162→   - Acceptance: App builds and runs correctly with 26.x SDK, all new visual features functional\n   163→\n   164→3. **Backward Compatibility**\n   165→   - Description: Maintain compatibility with earlier macOS (12+) and iOS (15+) versions\n   166→   - Acceptance: UI renders correctly on minimum supported OS versions, graceful degradation for unavailable features\n   167→\n   168→4. **Design Guide Documentation**\n   169→   - Description: Create comprehensive design guide covering all UI components, patterns, and usage instructions\n   170→   - Acceptance: Document exists at `docs/design-guide.md` with all screens, layouts, panels, buttons, and components documented\n   171→\n   172→5. **Cross-Platform Consistency**\n   173→   - Description: Ensure visual consistency between macOS and iOS while respecting platform conventions\n   174→   - Acceptance: Similar screens look related but follow their platform's HIG\n   175→\n   176→### Edge Cases\n   177→\n   178→1. **Performance on Older Hardware** - Implement fallback to reduced blur effects on systems without GPU acceleration\n   179→2. **High Contrast Mode** - Ensure accessibility by providing high contrast alternatives when system preference is enabled\n   180→3. **Dark/Light Mode** - Support both appearance modes with appropriate material selections\n   181→4. **Reduced Motion** - Disable or reduce animations when system reduced motion preference is enabled\n   182→5. **Notch/Dynamic Island** - Properly handle safe area insets and display cutouts on notched devices\n   183→\n   184→## Implementation Notes\n   185→\n   186→### DO\n   187→- Use SwiftUI for new UI components as it provides better cross-platform compatibility\n   188→- Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for platform-specific behaviors\n   189→- Test on actual devices/simulators with minimum supported OS versions\n   190→- Use version checks to conditionally enable 26.x-only features\n   191→- Document all new components in the design guide\n   192→\n   193→### DON'T\n   194→- Create custom blur implementations when native visual effect views are available\n   195→- Mix AppKit and SwiftUI inappropriately - prefer SwiftUI for new components\n   196→- Use hardcoded colors - always use semantic colors from the design system\n   197→- Skip accessibility testing - glassmorphism can affect readability\n   198→\n   199→## Development Environment\n   200→\n   201→### Prerequisites\n   202→- Xcode 15.0+\n   203→- macOS 14.0+ (for development)\n   204→- iOS 16.0+ Simulator\n   205→- Swift

73→## Files to Modify\n    74→\n    75→| File | Service | What to Change |\n    76→|------|---------|---------------|\n    77→| `macos/Sources/OpenClaw/**/*.swift` | macOS | Apply glassmorphism (NSVisualEffectView) to UI components |\n    78→| `ios/Sources/**/*.swift` | iOS | Apply blur effects (UIVisualEffectView) to UI components |\n    79→| `macos/Sources/OpenClaw/CanvasWindow.swift` | macOS | Implement glass panel design |\n    80→| `macos/Sources/OpenClaw/ChannelsSettings+View.swift` | macOS | Apply design system to settings panels |\n    81→| `ios/Sources/Settings/*.swift` | iOS | Apply design system to settings views |\n    82→| `macos/Sources/OpenClaw/*Settings*.swift` | macOS | Update all settings views with new design |\n    83→| `ios/Sources/*/*.swift` | iOS | Update all UI views with new design |\n    84→| **[Design Guide]** | Both | Create new `docs/design-guide.md` documenting all UI patterns |\n    85→\n    86→**Note**: Specific files will be identified during implementation via UI component audit.\n    87→\n    88→## Files to Reference\n    89→\n    90→These files provide patterns to follow:\n    91→\n    92→| File | Pattern to Copy |\n    93→|------|----------------|\n    94→| `macos/Sources/OpenClaw/CanvasWindow.swift` | Window/container structure for glassmorphism |\n    95→| `macos/Sources/OpenClaw/ContextMenuCardView.swift` | Card/popup UI component styling |\n    96→| `ios/Sources/Status/StatusPill.swift` | Status indicator component design |\n    97→| `ios/Sources/Status/VoiceWakeToast.swift` | Toast/notification component design |\n    98→| Apple Documentation: NSVisualEffectView | macOS glassmorphism implementation |\n    99→| Apple Documentation: UIVisualEffectView | iOS blur effect implementation |\n   100→| Apple Human Interface Guidelines | Platform-specific design patterns |\n   101→\n   102→## Patterns to Follow\n   103→\n   104→### Glassmorphism Effect (macOS)\n   105→\n   106→From Apple's NSVisualEffectView documentation:\n   107→\n   108→```swift\n   109→// Standard glass material implementation\n   110→let visualEffectView = NSVisualEffectView()\n   111→visualEffectView.material = .hudWindow\n   112→visualEffectView.blendingMode = .behindWindow\n   113→visualEffectView.state = .active\n   114→```\n   115→\n   116→**Key Points:**\n   117→- Use `.hudWindow` or `.popover` material for floating panels\n   118→- Use `.contentBackground` material for main content areas\n   119→- Set `blendingMode = .behindWindow` for translucent backgrounds\n   120→- State should be `.active` for interactive elements, `.inactive` for non-interactive\n   121→\n   122→### Blur Effect (iOS)\n   123→\n   124→From Apple's UIVisualEffectView documentation:\n   125→\n   126→```swift\n   127→// Standard blur implementation\n   128→let blurEffect = UIBlurEffect(style: .systemThickMaterial)\n   129→let visualEffectView = UIVisualEffectView(effect: blurEffect)\n   130→```\n   131→\n   132→**Key Points:**\n   133→- Use `.systemThickMaterial` for prominent glass effects\n   134→- Use `.systemMaterial` for standard content backgrounds\n   135→- Use `.systemUltraThinMaterial` for subtle overlays\n   136→- Apply to entire view backgrounds, not individual elements\n   137→\n   138→### SF Symbols Iconography\n   139→\n   140→```swift\n   141→// Consistent icon usage across platforms\n   142→Image(systemName: \"gear\")           // Settings\n   143→Image(systemName: \"house\")          // Home\n   144→Image(systemName: \"person.circle\")  // Profile\n   145→```\n   146→\n   147→**Key Points:**\n   148→- Use SF Symbols exclusively for all icons\n   149→- Prefer filled variants for selected states\n   150→- Maintain consistent point sizes (17pt for body, 22pt for navigation)\n   151→\n   152→## Requirements\n   153→\n   154→### Functional Requirements\n   155→\n   156→1. **Liquid Glass Design Implementation**\n   157→   - Description: Implement Apple's glassmorphism design across all UI components using NSVisualEffectView (macOS) and UIVisualEffectView (iOS)\n   158→   - Acceptance: All windows, panels, and floating elements display translucent glass effect with blur\n   159→\n   160→2. **Version 26.x Support**\n   161→   - Description: Ensure all UI components support version 26.x feature requirements including new material styles and animations\n   162→   - Acceptance: App builds and runs correctly with 26.x SDK, all new visual features functional\n   163→\n   164→3. **Backward Compatibility**\n   165→   - Description: Maintain compatibility with earlier macOS (12+) and iOS (15+) versions\n   166→   - Acceptance: UI renders correctly on minimum supported OS versions, graceful degradation for unavailable features\n   167→\n   168→4. **Design Guide Documentation**\n   169→   - Description: Create comprehensive design guide covering all UI components, patterns, and usage instructions\n   170→   - Acceptance: Document exists at `docs/design-guide.md` with all screens, layouts, panels, buttons, and components documented\n   171→\n   172→5. **Cross-Platform Consistency**\n   173→   - Description: Ensure visual consistency between macOS and iOS while respecting platform conventions\n   174→   - Acceptance: Similar screens look related but follow their platform's HIG\n   175→\n   176→### Edge Cases\n   177→\n   178→1. **Performance on Older Hardware** - Implement fallback to reduced blur effects on systems without GPU acceleration\n   179→2. **High Contrast Mode** - Ensure accessibility by providing high contrast alternatives when system preference is enabled\n   180→3. **Dark/Light Mode** - Support both appearance modes with appropriate material selections\n   181→4. **Reduced Motion** - Disable or reduce animations when system reduced motion preference is enabled\n   182→5. **Notch/Dynamic Island** - Properly handle safe area insets and display cutouts on notched devices\n   183→\n   184→## Implementation Notes\n   185→\n   186→### DO\n   187→- Use SwiftUI for new UI components as it provides better cross-platform compatibility\n   188→- Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for platform-specific behaviors\n   189→- Test on actual devices/simulators with minimum supported OS versions\n   190→- Use version checks to conditionally enable 26.x-only features\n   191→- Document all new components in the design guide\n   192→\n   193→### DON'T\n   194→- Create custom blur implementations when native visual effect views are available\n   195→- Mix AppKit and SwiftUI inappropriately - prefer SwiftUI for new components\n   196→- Use hardcoded colors - always use semantic colors from the design system\n   197→- Skip accessibility testing - glassmorphism can affect readability\n   198→\n   199→## Development Environment\n   200→\n   201→### Prerequisites\n   202→- Xcode 15.0+\n   203→- macOS 14.0+ (for development)\n   204→- iOS 16.0+ Simulator\n   205→- Swift 5.9+\n   206→\n   207→### Start Services\n   208→\n   209→```bash\n   210→# Verify XcodeGen is installed\n   211→which xcodegen || brew install xcodegen\n   212→\n   213→# Generate Xcode projects (if

The system implements Apple's glassmorphism design language using native visual effect APIs on both platforms.\n    17→\n    18→### Design Principles\n    19→\n    20→- **Translucency**: Surfaces appear frosted and translucent, allowing background content to blur through\n    21→- **Depth**: Layered surfaces create visual hierarchy through varying blur intensities\n    22→- **Platform Consistency**: Visual effects follow platform conventions while maintaining brand coherence\n    23→- **Accessibility**: All effects support accessibility features including reduced motion and high contrast modes\n    24→\n    25→### Target Platforms\n    26→\n    27→| Platform | Minimum Version | Visual Effect API |\n    28→|----------|-----------------|-------------------|\n    29→| macOS |

The system implements Apple's glassmorphism design language using native visual effect APIs on both platforms.\n    17→\n    18→### Design Principles\n    19→\n    20→- **Translucency**: Surfaces appear frosted and translucent, allowing background content to blur through\n    21→- **Depth**: Layered surfaces create visual hierarchy through varying blur intensities\n    22→- **Platform Consistency**: Visual effects follow platform conventions while maintaining brand coherence\n    23→- **Accessibility**: All effects support accessibility features including reduced motion and high contrast modes\n    24→\n    25→### Target Platforms\n    26→\n    27→| Platform | Minimum Version | Visual Effect API |\n    28→|----------|-----------------|-------------------|\n    29→| macOS | 12.0 (Monterey) | NSVisualEffectView |\n    30→| iOS | 15.0 | UIVisualEffectView / SwiftUI Materials |\n    31→\n    32→---\n    33→\n    34→## macOS Glassmorphism\n    35→\n    36→### NSVisualEffectView Implementation\n    37→\n    38→The foundation of macOS glassmorphism is the `NSVisualEffectView` class, which provides hardware-accelerated blur and vibrancy effects.\n    39→\n    40→```swift\n    41→// Standard glass material implementation\n    42→let visualEffectView = NSVisualEffectView()\n    43→visualEffectView.material = .hudWindow\n    44→visualEffectView.blendingMode = .behindWindow\n    45→visualEffectView.state = .active\n    46→```\n    47→\n    48→### Material Types\n    49→\n    50→| Material | Use Case |\n    51→|----------|----------|\n    52→| `.hudWindow` |

56→| `.windowBackground` | Window backgrounds |\n    57→| `.underWindow` | Underlying window layers |\n    58→\n    59→### Blending Modes\n    60→\n    61→| Mode | Effect |\n    62→|------|--------|\n    63→| `.behindWindow` | Effect appears behind the view's content |\n    64→| `.withinWindow` | Effect blends with window background |\n    65→\n    66→### State Configuration\n    67→\n    68→| State | Use Case |\n    69→|-------|----------|\n    70→| `.active` | Interactive elements, visible blur |\n    71→| `.inactive` | Non-interactive, subtle effect |\n    72→| `.followsWindowActiveState` | Syncs with window focus |\n    73→\n    74→### Emphasized Property\n    75→\n    76→The `isEmphasized` property controls whether the view uses its emphasized appearance, typically affecting vibrancy intensity:\n    77→\n    78→```swift\n    79→visualEffectView.isEmphasized = true // Enhanced vibrancy for active elements\n    80→```\n    81→\n    82→### SwiftUI

The system implements Apple's glassmorphism design language using native visual effect APIs on both platforms.\n    17→\n    18→### Design Principles\n    19→\n    20→- **Translucency**: Surfaces appear frosted and translucent, allowing background content to blur through\n    21→- **Depth**: Layered surfaces create visual hierarchy through varying blur intensities\n    22→- **Platform Consistency**: Visual effects follow platform conventions while maintaining brand coherence\n    23→- **Accessibility**: All effects support accessibility features including reduced motion and high contrast modes\n    24→\n    25→### Target Platforms\n    26→\n    27→| Platform | Minimum Version | Visual Effect API |\n    28→|----------|-----------------|-------------------|\n    29→| macOS |

NSVisualEffectView Implementation\n    37→\n    38→The foundation of macOS glassmorphism is the `NSVisualEffectView` class, which provides hardware-accelerated blur and vibrancy effects.\n    39→\n    40→```swift\n    41→// Standard glass material implementation\n    42→let visualEffectView = NSVisualEffectView()\n    43→visualEffectView.material = .hudWindow\n    44→visualEffectView.blendingMode =

`.followsWindowActiveState` | Syncs with window focus |\n    73→\n    74→### Emphasized Property\n    75→\n    76→The `isEmphasized` property controls whether the view uses its emphasized appearance, typically affecting vibrancy intensity:\n    77→\n    78→```swift\n    79→visualEffectView.isEmphasized = true // Enhanced vibrancy for active elements\n    80→```\n    81→\n    82→### SwiftUI
