    "patterns_discovered": [
      "Native visual effect APIs are core to implementation - NSVisualEffectView on macOS, UIVisualEffectView/SwiftUI Materials on iOS",
      "Material system uses semantic naming (.hudWindow, .popover, .systemThinMaterial)",
      "Platform-specific minimum versions required (macOS 12.0+, iOS 15.0+)",
      "Semantic colors automatically adapt to light/dark mode via system colors",
      "8pt grid system for consistent spacing",
      "Accessibility is built-in requirement with explicit environment variable usage",

    "gotchas_discovered": [
      "Different visual effect APIs across platforms - no unified API",
      "Material names differ between platforms (e.g., .hudWindow vs .systemThickMaterial)",
      "Reduced motion preference requires explicit handling in code",
      "Blur effects require hardware acceleration - may not work on all devices",
      "High contrast mode may reduce visual effect visibility",
      "Some blur styles have different availability across iOS versions",
      "Static fallback colors needed for devices that cannot render blur effects"

    "approach_outcome": "Successfully created a comprehensive 330-line design guide documenting the complete Tahoe 26.x glassmorphism design system with platform-specific implementation details, code examples, component library structure, color/typography/spacing systems, accessibility requirements, and backward compatibility strategies. The guide follows Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and includes implementation checklist.",
    "recommendations": [
      "Implement the documented components (GlassPanel, GlassCard, GlassButton, GlassSheet for macOS; BlurView, GlassContainer, GlassButton, GlassCard for iOS) following the guide specifications",
      "Add automated design token validation tests to ensure spacing, colors, and typography match the design guide",
      "Set up CI/CD pipeline to automatically generate and publish design documentation",
      "Consider creating a shared Swift Package for common design system utilities",
      "Add interactive playground/examples app demonstrating all components",
      "Implement visual regression tests for glass effects across OS versions",
      "Create dark mode and accessibility audit tooling",
      "Document component props/API in TypeScript if cross-platform React Native support is planned"
