    "approach_outcome": "SUCCESS - Implemented in first attempt. The mode-aware rendering correctly filters tabs: Basic mode shows only Overview and Files tabs (2 tabs), Advanced mode shows all 6 tabs. The implementation is clean with a simple boolean flag (isBasic) passed through to control rendering behavior.",
    "recommendations": [
      "Apply similar mode-aware rendering to other views (e.g., tools.ts, skills.ts) for consistency",
      "Consider extracting mode-aware tab filtering into a reusable utility function",
      "Document the mode-aware pattern for future contributors",
      "The filtering approach (filter array based on condition) is clean and can be reused for other mode-specific UI elements"
