    "approach_outcome": "SUCCESS - Implemented Basic mode simplified view with conditional rendering that reduces displayed fields from 7 to 2 in Gateway Access form, reduces snapshot stats from 5 to 2, removes Cron column, hides Notes section, and hides Channels callout.

      "Apply similar mode-based conditional rendering pattern to other views (storage.ts, presenter.ts)",

      "Document which elements are hidden in Basic mode for consistency",
