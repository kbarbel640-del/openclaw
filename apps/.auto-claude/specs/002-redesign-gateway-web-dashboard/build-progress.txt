Project: Redesign Gateway Web Dashboard
Workspace: /Users/jkneen/Documents/GitHub/atomicbot/apps
Started: 2026-02-14

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: This is a feature development task involving UI redesign with Basic/Advanced mode toggle. All work is in the UI service (Lit Web Components). No backend changes required.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 6
- Total subtasks: 18
- Created init.sh

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure): 3 subtasks - Add mode state to storage and app.ts
- Phase 2 (Navigation): 3 subtasks - Mode-aware tab filtering and navigation guards
- Phase 3 (Views - Basic): 3 subtasks - Simplify overview, sessions, config for Basic mode
- Phase 4 (Views - Advanced): 6 subtasks - Ensure full functionality in Advanced mode
- Phase 5 (Design System): 2 subtasks - Add AI SDK-inspired design tokens
- Phase 6 (Testing): 2 subtasks - Unit tests for mode functionality

Services Involved:
- ui (primary): Lit Web Components dashboard at /Users/jkneen/Documents/GitHub/atomicbot/ui

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 3
- Recommended workers: 2
- Parallel groups: phase-3-views-basic, phase-4-views-advanced, phase-5-design-system (all depend on phase-2)

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  cd /Users/jkneen/Documents/GitHub/atomicbot/ui && npm run dev

Then implement subtasks from implementation_plan.json

=== END SESSION 1 ===

=== SUBTASK 4-6 COMPLETED ===
Date: 2026-02-14
Task: Update debug.ts - Advanced mode only view with full functionality
Status: COMPLETED
Notes: debug.ts already contained full Advanced mode implementation with:
  - Snapshots section (status, health, heartbeat with security audit)
  - Manual RPC section for raw gateway method calls
  - Models catalog display
  - Event log with formatted entries
Verification: Build succeeded (npm run build)
Plan Updated: subtask-4-6 status set to "completed"
