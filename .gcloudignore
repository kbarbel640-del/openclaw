# GCP Cloud Build upload ignore file
# Goal: keep build context small, but ALWAYS include package manifests/lockfiles.

# --- Always include critical root manifests ---
!package.json
!.npmrc
!pnpm-lock.yaml
!pnpm-workspace.yaml
!Dockerfile
!.dockerignore

# --- Always include source and build scripts needed by Dockerfile ---
!src/**
!packages/**
!ui/**
!patches/**
!scripts/**
!tsconfig*.json

# --- Exclude heavy/unneeded stuff ---
