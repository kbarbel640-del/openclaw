Calls gateway 'agent' method internally. Returns { runId }.\n- waitForRun(params): Block until a run completes. Calls gateway 'agent.wait' internally. Returns { status, error? }.\n- deleteSession(params): Delete an ephemeral session. Calls gateway 'sessions.delete' internally. Returns void.\n\nImplementation:\n1. Add subagent types and property to src/plugins/runtime/types.ts\n2. Wire implementation in wherever PluginRuntime is constructed (look at src/gateway/server-plugins.ts or similar). Use handleGatewayRequest with a synthetic operator client for internal dispatch — NOT callGateway which opens a WebSocket to itself.\n3. Export types from plugin-sdk/index.ts so external plugins can reference them.\n4. Add tests.\n\nBranch: josh/context-engine (already checked out)\nDo NOT touch any other branch.","priority":"1","title":"Add scoped subagent methods to PluginRuntime","type":"task"}}

Earlier we downgraded to v0.6.1 (SSE) because we thought mcporter 0.7.3 didn't support streamable-http. Investigation shows mcporter 0.7.3 DOES import StreamableHTTPClientTransport and uses it for HTTP baseUrl configs.\n\nCurrent state:\n- mcporter.json has claude-team at baseUrl http://localhost:8766/mcp\n- claude-team was downgraded to v0.6.1 (SSE), but v0.6.1 needs iTerm2 Python API running\n- mcporter 0.7.3 transport.js line 4: imports StreamableHTTPClientTransport\n- mcporter 0.7.3 transport.js line 92: uses it for HTTP command URLs\n\nNext steps:\n1. Re-upgrade claude-team to v0.10.0 (npm install)\n2. Start the server (need to figure out how - may need iTerm2 or can it run standalone?)\n3. Test mcporter call claude-team.list_workers\n4.
