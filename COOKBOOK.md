**Prompt:**
```
Tonight's NBA slate:
- Celtics (-4.5) at Knicks
- Thunder (-8) vs Grizzlies
- Warriors (+2) at Lakers

For each game:
1. Tell me the implied win probability from the spread

Here's my current portfolio:
BTC: 0.5 (current price $X)
ETH: 3.2 (current price $X)
SOL: 25 (current price $X)

My targets are 60% BTC, 30% ETH, 10% SOL.

1. Calculate my current allocation percentages
2. Identify which positions have drifted more than 5% from target
3. Generate buy-only rebalancing trades to get back to target
4. Estimate the tax impact of any sells if I weren't using buy-only mode

## 4. NFT Floor Alert Digest

Track whether any of your watched collections are showing unusual floor movement.

```
Check the following NFT collections and tell me:

4. Whether I should be paying attention (flag if floor moved > 10% in 24h)

```

**Skills used:** `nft-tracker`

**Pro tip:** Set a threshold alert so the bot only messages you when floors move significantly:

Only alert me if any floor price moves more than 15% in 24 hours.
Check every 6 hours and send a Telegram message if triggered.
```

## Combining Skills: Advanced Workflows

### The Full Pre-Bet Checklist
```
Before I place this bet [describe bet], run through:
1. Kelly sizing at my edge estimate
2. This team's current streak and regression signal
3. Market sentiment (is this a sharp or public bet?)
4. Any injury news affecting the line
5. Final recommendation: bet, pass, or reduce size
```

1. Show me the 3 lowest-floor collections with positive 7-day volume trend

3. What's the historical pattern for BAYC floors when Fear & Greed drops below 25?
4. Recommend whether to buy now or wait

## Tips

- **Be specific** — the more context you give (current price, exact odds, bankroll size), the better the output
- **Chain skills** — start with `market-sentiment` to get directional bias, then use `kelly-criterion` to size your bet
- **Use the journal** — all this analysis means nothing if you don't track results in `bet-journal`
- **Automate the boring stuff** — set up crons for the daily brief, weekly P&L review, and portfolio checks
