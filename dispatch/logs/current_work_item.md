`EPIC-MVP-07: Pilot Readiness`

## Priority
`P1`

## Completion Status
`MVP-01`, `MVP-02`, `MVP-03`, `MVP-04`, `MVP-05`, `MVP-06`, and `MVP-07` are complete and validated. `MVP-08` is now in readiness validation with full pass signals and a published go/no-go checklist.

## Suggested Focus Area
Execute pilot UAT and cutover readiness:
- run ops SME UAT across dispatcher/technician lifecycle paths
- validate rollback rehearsal and release-candidate freeze controls
- produce pilot cutover checklist with explicit go/no-go gates
- confirm operational handoff evidence for launch approval
- current validation is complete for the full pilot matrix runbook path
