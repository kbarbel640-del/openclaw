# Current Work Item

## Story ID
`MVP-07`

## Canonical Backlog
`ai_dispatch_agile_project_package/backlog/backlog.csv`

## Epic
`EPIC-MVP-06: UX MVP Build`

## Priority
`P1`

## Completion Status
`MVP-01`, `MVP-02`, `MVP-03`, `MVP-04`, `MVP-05`, and `MVP-06` are complete and validated. `MVP-07` is now the next critical path item.

## Suggested Focus Area
Implement dispatcher cockpit and technician packet execution surfaces:
- map all UI actions strictly to closed dispatch-api command/read endpoints
- expose fail-closed policy errors (role/tool/state/scope/evidence) in operator-visible UX states
- render timeline, evidence status, and closeout gate feedback from API truth only
- verify role-restricted UX flows for dispatcher and technician personas
