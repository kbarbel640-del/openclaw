# Next Story Recommendation

No remaining stories in the v0 backlog.

Recommended follow-on (post-v0 hardening):
1. Production authn/authz integration (replace header-based actor context).
2. Remaining command/read endpoint completion to full OpenAPI parity.
3. External metrics backend integration and alert policy tuning.
