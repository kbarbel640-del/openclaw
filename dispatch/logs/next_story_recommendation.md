# Next Story Recommendation

Canonical backlog source:
- `ai_dispatch_agile_project_package/backlog/backlog.csv`

Recommended immediate start:
1. `MVP-08` pilot UAT and cutover readiness (if not already executed in this branch).
2. Publish go/no-go decision evidence and finalize pilot launch handoff.

Then execute remaining work in rank/dependency order from the canonical backlog.
