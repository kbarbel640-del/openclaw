---

## 🚨 CRITICAL WORK NEEDED (Before Publishing)

### 1. Package Naming (Impact: CRITICAL)
**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE  
**Time:** 30 minutes

**What needs to change:**
- `package.json` name: `openclaw` → `gensparx`
- Binary: `openclaw.mjs` → `gensparx.mjs`
- CLI command: `openclaw` → `gensparx`

**User impact:** Users can't install or run the project

---

### 2. Environment Variables (Impact: CRITICAL)
**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE  
**Time:** 1 hour

**What needs to change:**
- `OPENCLAW_*` → `GENSPARX_*` (20+ variables)
- Examples: `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` → `GENSPARX_GATEWAY_TOKEN`

**User impact:** Build scripts and CI/CD pipelines break

---

### 3. Configuration Directory (Impact: HIGH)
**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE  
**Time:** 1 hour

**What needs to change:**
- `~/.openclaw/` → `~/.gensparx/`
- Migration path needed for existing users

**User impact:** Users lose their config/credentials

---

### 4. App Bundle IDs (Impact: CRITICAL FOR MOBILE)
**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE  
**Time:** 1 hour

**What needs to change:**
- macOS: `ai.openclaw.mac` → `ai.gensparx.mac`
- iOS: `ai.openclaw.ios` → `ai.gensparx.ios`
- Android: `ai.openclaw.android` → `ai.gensparx.android`

**User impact:** Apps won't install/run with wrong IDs; requires app store resubmission

---

### 5. Extension Packages (Impact: HIGH)
**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE  
**Time:** 1.5 hours

**What needs to change:**
- `@openclaw/*` → `@gensparx/*` (30+ extension packages)

**User impact:** Extensions won't load

---

### 6. Documentation (Impact: HIGH)
**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE  
**Time:** 2 hours

**What needs to change:**
- Update 50+ `.md` files with `gensparx` commands
- Update CLI examples and code snippets

**User impact:** Users follow outdated docs and get confused

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED PUBLICATION TIMELINE

### Option A: Full Rebranding (Recommended)
**Effort:** 8-9 hours

1. **Day 1 (4 hours):**
   - Complete all Critical tasks (Phases 1-2)
   - Run validation tests
   - Commit changes

2. **Day 2 (3 hours):**
   - Update documentation
   - Update app names
   - Final polish

3. **Day 3 (1-2 hours):**
   - Prepare for npm publish
   - Create release notes
   - Publish version

**Result:** Production-ready GenSparx with zero OpenClaw references

---

### Option B: Minimum Viable Rebranding (Not Recommended)
**Effort:** 2 hours

Do only Phase 1 (Critical tasks):
- Rename package
- Update CLI commands
- Update bundle IDs
- Update environment variables

**Risks:**
- Documentation still shows `openclaw` commands
- Users confused by mixed naming
- Incomplete brand migration

**Result:** Functional but confusing for users

---

### Option C: Gradual Migration (Most User-Friendly)
**Effort:** 9-10 hours + maintenance

1. Do full rebranding (all phases)
2. Keep `openclaw` as alias/symlink
3. Show deprecation warning when using `openclaw`
4. Support both names for 1-2 releases

**Result:** Users have migration period; less friction

---

## ❓ QUESTIONS?

**Q: Can I publish with just the system prompt changes?**  
A: Not really - the CLI still says `openclaw`, config still at `~/.openclaw/`, etc. It would confuse users.

**Q: How long to do full rebranding?**  
A: 8-9 hours if you follow the guides carefully. Could be faster if you know search & replace well.

**Q: Do I need to do everything?**  
A: At minimum: Package name, CLI commands, bundle IDs, and environment variables. Everything else affects user experience.

**Q: What if I don't rebrand the mobile apps?**  
A: They'll still show as "OpenClaw" to users. Create cognitive dissonance.

**Q: Can I support both `openclaw` and `gensparx`?**  
A: Yes, if you want backwards compatibility. More work upfront but easier for users.
