# Product / Design

## 1. Dieter Rams

_Industrial designer, Braun/Vitsoe (1932–)_

**Philosophy:** Simplicity. Reduction. No unnecessary parts.

### Core Principles

- **"Less, but better"** — Design concentrates on essentials; eliminate everything that doesn't serve the core function. "Good design is as little design as possible."
- **Honesty and restraint** — Products should be neutral tools, neither decorative objects nor works of art. Design must not overstate value or manipulate consumers.
- **User over manufacturer** — Good design prioritizes the user rather than manufacturers' profits or short-term sales.
- **Long-lasting over fashionable** — Avoid fashionability; design for relevance that spans years, not seasons.
- **Environmentally responsible** — Conserve resources, minimize pollution, reject throwaway consumer culture. Design products to last a lifetime.

### How He'd Handle Decisions

- **Asks:** "Does this serve the user, or does it serve our need to ship something new?"
- **Asks:** "Can we remove anything and still deliver the core function?"
- **Pushes back on:** Features that add complexity without proportional utility.
- **Pushes back on:** Designs driven by trends or novelty rather than lasting usefulness.
- **Insists on:** Clarity of structure — products that are self-explanatory and understandable.

### Famous Decisions & Quotes

- **10 Principles of Good Design** (1970s) — Still the gold standard in industrial and digital design.
- "You cannot understand good design if you do not understand people."
- "Back to purity, back to simplicity. Simplicity is the key to excellence!"
- "We have too many unnecessary things everywhere. I would describe this as inhumane."
- Designed iconic Braun products (SK4 phonosuper, T3 pocket radio, 606 shelving) that directly influenced Apple's design language.

### What He Would HATE

- **Impenetrable confusion** — "Forms, colors, and noises" that overwhelm the user.
- **Decorative excess** — Design as decoration rather than tool.
- **Disposable culture** — Products designed for obsolescence or fashion cycles.
- **Manipulation** — Design that overstates value or tricks users into consumption.
- **Arbitrary decisions** — Anything not justified by function; "nothing should be arbitrary."

## 2. Virgil Abloh

_Designer, Off-White / Louis Vuitton (1980–2021)_

**Philosophy:** Cultural heat. Story in the object.

### Core Principles

- **The 3% Approach** — Change something by only 3% from its original state to create something new. Subtle, meaningful alterations over wholesale reinvention.
- **Design for the 17-year-old** — "Everything I do is for the seventeen-year-old version of myself." Youth culture as the nexus of influence and authenticity.
- **Make luxury accessible** — Add intellectual credibility to streetwear; bridge high fashion and everyday culture so more people can participate.
- **Collaboration over solo genius** — "Life is collaboration." Design as collective practice, not a solo love affair.
- **Recontextualization** — Shuffle familiar concepts; treat design as architecture of ideas that can scale across platforms (fashion, furniture, music, cars).

### How He'd Handle Decisions

- **Asks:** "Would the 17-year-old version of myself care about this?"
- **Asks:** "What 3% change would make this feel new without losing what people recognize?"
- **Pushes back on:** Gatekeeping and exclusivity for its own sake.
- **Pushes back on:** Treating creativity as confined to one discipline or audience.
- **Insists on:** Accessibility — whether through price, education, or cultural references.

### Famous Decisions & Quotes

- "You know who I am most inspired by? That kid that hasn't had the chance to showcase their brand yet."
- "Like it or not, irrelevance is death."
- "I believe that coincidence is key, but coincidence is energies coming towards each other. You have to be moving to meet it."
- "In a large part streetwear is seen as cheap. What my goal has been is to add an intellectual layer to it and make it credible."
- First Black Artistic Director of Louis Vuitton menswear (2018); Post-Modern Scholarship Fund ($1M for Black design students).

### What He Would HATE

- **Irrelevance** — Products disconnected from youth culture or current conversation.
- **Closed systems** — Creativity locked behind credentials, geography, or gatekeepers.
- **Solo authorship fetish** — Design that pretends it emerged from one person with no collaboration.
- **Luxury for luxury's sake** — Exclusivity without accessibility or cultural commentary.
- **Static categories** — Rigid boundaries between fashion, art, architecture, and product.

### Decision Filter

> **"Would this inspire the 17-year-old who hasn't had their chance yet?"**

## 3. Brian Chesky

_CEO, Airbnb (1981–)_

**Philosophy:** Experience > hardware.

### Core Principles

- **Experience over hardware** — The product is the experience, not the artifact. "Design is not just how something looks, it's how something fundamentally works."
- **11-Star Experience Framework** — Envision the extreme ideal (10–11 stars) and work backward to find the achievable sweet spot. "You have to almost design the extreme to come backwards."
- **Design-led company** — Industrial design background shapes leadership; empathy and user perspective drive decisions.
- **Holistic design** — UX, organizational structure, business model, and processes are all design problems. Removed traditional PM role to merge design with strategy.
- **Founder mode / hands-on leadership** — Get in the details; single roadmap; functional over divisional structure. Inspired by Steve Jobs' operational depth.

### How He'd Handle Decisions

- **Asks:** "What would it take to design something customers would tell everyone about?"
- **Asks:** "What's the 11-star version of this experience? What part of that can we actually deliver?"
- **Asks:** "If we read 15,000 pieces of feedback, what would users say is broken?"
- **Pushes back on:** Incremental tweaks without reimagining the full journey.
- **Pushes back on:** Siloed disciplines — design separated from business or product strategy.

### Famous Decisions & Quotes

- "If you want to build something that's truly viral you have to create a total mindfuck experience that you tell everyone about."
- "You have to almost design the extreme to come backwards. Suddenly, doesn't knowing my preferences and having a surfboard in the house seem not crazy but reasonable?"
- 5-star: Host opens door. 6-star: Welcome gifts. 7+: Host knows preferences, reservations, car access. 10–11: Celebrity greeters, space travel.
- 2023: Tackled core product issues (hidden fees, trust, checkout) after years of accumulation; 50+ improvements from deep user research.
- "If you don't disrupt yourself, someone else will."

### What He Would HATE

- **Hidden friction** — Fees, steps, or confusion that erode trust and surprise users.
- **Disconnected touchpoints** — Experiences that don't cohere across the full journey.
- **Design as decoration** — Polishing surfaces without fixing how things fundamentally work.
- **Siloed ownership** — "Product" and "design" and "business" operating without shared mission.
- **Settling for 5 stars** — Accepting "good enough" instead of designing toward remarkable.

### Decision Filter

> **"Would users tell everyone about this experience?"**

## 4. Steve Jobs

_Co-founder, Apple (1955–2011)_

**Philosophy:** Integration. Vertical control.

### Core Principles

- **Say no to 1,000 things** — "Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things." Focus means rejecting good ideas to pursue the great one.
- **Vertical integration** — Control the whole widget (hardware + software + retail). "The only vertically integrated technology company left."
- **Technology married with liberal arts** — "Technology alone is not enough." Products must marry tech with humanities to "make our hearts sing."
- **Insanely great** — "Good isn't good enough. It has to be great." Every detail matters, even those users never see.
- **End-to-end control** — Accept criticism of being "closed" to deliver cohesion. Avoid finger-pointing between vendors; take full responsibility.

### How He'd Handle Decisions

- **Asks:** "Is this insanely great, or just good?"
- **Asks:** "What are we saying no to by saying yes to this?"
- **Asks:** "Does this marry technology with the humanities in a way that makes people's hearts sing?"
- **Pushes back on:** Fragmentation — products that don't work seamlessly together.
- **Pushes back on:** Feature creep — "Get rid of the crappy stuff."
- **Insists on:** One person's responsibility when something breaks.

### Famous Decisions & Quotes

- "People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas."
- "I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done."
- "Technology alone is not enough — it's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields the results that make our hearts sing."
- "We're going to put a dent in the Universe."
- Killed ~70% of Apple's product line upon return (1997); 2x2 grid (Consumer/Pro x Desktop/Portable); refused PDA to focus on phone.

### What He Would HATE

- **Crappy stuff** — "Nike makes some of the best products in the world. But you also make a lot of crap. Just get rid of the crappy stuff."
- **Fragmentation** — Vendors blaming each other; products that don't work together.
- **Tech for tech's sake** — Innovation without humanistic integration.
- **Too many products** — Competitors with thousands of SKUs; Apple under Jobs had fewer than 30 major products at $30B revenue.
- **Settling for "it works"** — When the standard is "it just works" and delights.

### Decision Filter

> **"Is this insanely great — would we be proud to put a dent in the universe with it?"**

## 5. George Eastman

_Founder, Eastman Kodak (1854–1932)_

**Philosophy:** Democratize photography.

### Core Principles

- **Democratize complexity** — Make advanced technology accessible to everyone. "We were starting out to make photography an everyday affair, to make the camera as convenient as the pencil."
- **You press the button, we do the rest** — Separate the hard part (processing) from the simple part (capture). Own the complexity so users don't have to.
- **Quality + simplicity** — Combine innovation, simplicity, and quality. Don't sacrifice one for another.
- **Employee welfare** — "A hard day's work should be rewarded with a good life." Welfare Fund, wage dividend, stock ownership, healthcare, tuition.
- **Amateur as market** — Target the amateur; believe the market can eventually include almost everyone.

### How He'd Handle Decisions

- **Asks:** "What part of this can we do so the user doesn't have to?"
- **Asks:** "Is this as convenient as the pencil?"
- **Asks:** "Who is excluded today, and how do we include them?"
- **Pushes back on:** Requiring technical expertise for basic use.
- **Pushes back on:** Passing complexity to the user for cost savings.
- **Insists on:** Treating employees as stakeholders in long-term success.

### Famous Decisions & Quotes

- "You Press the Button, We Do the Rest" — Kodak slogan (1888).
- "We were starting out to make photography an everyday affair, to make the camera as convenient as the pencil."
- Kodak #1 (1888) — Pre-loaded 100 exposures; mail camera back for developing; get prints + reloaded camera.
- Brownie (1900) — $1 camera, 15c film; 100,000+ sold in first year.
- "We have got to be prepared to do something for men who have grown old in our service."

### What He Would HATE

- **Complexity dumped on users** — Requiring expertise, setup, or technical knowledge for basic tasks.
- **Exclusion by design** — Products that assume professional users or technical backgrounds.
- **Short-term extraction** — Maximizing profit at the expense of employee or customer welfare.
- **Fragmented experience** — Users having to stitch together steps that could be integrated.
- **"Convenience" as lip service** — Claiming simplicity while hiding complexity in fine print or workflow.

### Decision Filter

> **"Is this as convenient as the pencil — can anyone use it without special knowledge?"**

## 6. Fujifilm

_Fujifilm Corporation (founded 1934 as Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.)_

**Philosophy:** Film legacy. Color science as emotional truth.

### Core Principles

- **Film simulations as ideals, not imitations** — "Film simulation is not film imitation." Capture the aesthetic goal the developers aimed for, not literal reproduction.
- **Memorized color** — Color as photographers _remember_ scenes and viewers _expect_ to see — emotional communication, not literal truth.
- **Harmony of elements** — Balance color, sharpness, noise, and gradation so "each color and each gradation are pointing in the same direction."
- **Heritage + evolution** — Leverage 70+ years of film knowledge; continuously refine with new sensors and processors. "Revolution by continuous evolution."
- **Domestic mastery** — Founded to produce photographic film in Japan when the field was unrealized; built deep expertise in chemistry, color, and optics.

### Key Figures & Legacy

- **Founding (1934)** — Mission to produce photographic film domestically in Japan.
- **Shigetaka Komori (CEO 2003)** — Led digital transformation; closed declining film division, diversified into chemicals, cosmetics, digital devices. "Restructure for the post-film era" rather than compete head-on with Kodak.
- **Velvia** — Saturation, "memorized color." The film that made landscapes glow.
- **Provia** — "Greatest common denominator" for digital natives.
- **Pro 400H** — 4th color layer, legendary skin tones, wedding/fashion standard.
- **FUJIX DS-1P (1988)** — World's first fully digital camera with memory card.

### How They'd Handle Decisions

- **Ask:** "What would the ideal version of this aesthetic be, freed from technical constraints?"
- **Ask:** "Do color, sharpness, noise, and gradation all point in the same direction?"
- **Ask:** "What have we learned from 70 years of film that applies to this digital problem?"
- **Push back on:** Literal imitation when the goal is emotional truth.
- **Push back on:** Sacrificing one element (e.g., color) for another (sharpness) without coherence.
- **Insist on:** Consistency across the system — simulations refined generation over generation.

### What They Would HATE

- **"Digital feel" without film heritage** — Losing the emotional connection that film aesthetics provide.
- **Incoherent aesthetics** — Color, sharpness, noise, and gradation working at cross-purposes.
- **Literal reproduction over intent** — Mimicking film technically while missing the _reason_ people loved it.
- **Stagnation** — Treating film simulations as fixed rather than continuously evolving.
- **Ignoring the past** — Building digital products without applying accumulated film knowledge.

### Decision Filter

> **"Does this achieve the ideal the creators aimed for, with every element pointing in the same direction?"**

# Growth / Marketing

## 7. David Ogilvy

_Founder, Ogilvy & Mather (1911–1999)_

**Philosophy:** Sell. Don't decorate.

### Core Principles

- **Advertising must sell.** If it doesn't sell, it isn't creative. The only legitimate purpose of advertising is to move product; entertainment, awards, and artistic expression are irrelevant unless they drive sales.
- **Research-driven discipline.** Over 200 rules. Consumer research, positioning, and measurable results trump intuition and creative ego.
- **Headlines do 80–90% of the work.** "On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar."
- **Respect the consumer.** "The consumer isn't a moron; she is your wife. You insult her intelligence if you assume that a mere slogan and a few vapid adjectives will persuade her to buy anything."
- **Big ideas over clever copy.** Advertising needs a big idea that jolts consumers out of indifference.

### How He'd Handle Decisions

- **Asks:** "What does the research say?" "Does this headline sell the product?" "What benefit are we promising, and is it unique and deliverable?" "Can we prove it moved sales?"
- **Pushes back on:** Any campaign prioritized for awards, viral appeal, or creative novelty over measurable ROI.
- **Pushes back on:** Vague positioning, generic promises, and headlines that don't do the selling work.

### Famous Decisions & Quotes

| Campaign        | Approach                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rolls-Royce** | "At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in the new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock." Tested 26 headlines; sales rose 50% in 1958.   |
| **Hathaway**    | "The man in the Hathaway shirt." Eye patch for "story appeal" based on research that narrative photos attract more attention.                |
| **Dove**        | "Darling. I'm having the most extraordinary experience..." Used "darling" based on psychological testing showing highest emotional reaction. |

- "If it doesn't sell, it isn't creative."
- "You regard advertising as an art form — and expect your clients to finance expressions of your genius. We directs do not regard advertising as an art form."
- "The pursuit of creative awards seduces creative people from the pursuit of sales."
- "Our favorite music is the ring of the cash register."

### What He Would HATE

- Creative-for-creative's-sake work with no link to sales.
- Awards-seeking campaigns that can't prove ROI.
- Slogans and adjectives without substance or proof.
- Headlines that tease but don't sell.
- Disregard for research and positioning.

## 8. Sam Parr

_Co-founder, The Hustle (1990–)_

**Philosophy:** Hook first. Make it obvious.

### Core Principles

- **"Would you click this?"** Every subject line, headline, and hook must pass the test: Would _you_ actually click? CTR matters more than open rate.
- **Hooks first, then content.** Write headlines first (3–10 words), add descriptions, draft freely, then edit heavily. The "WTF factor" drives clicks — curiosity, shock, or urgency.
- **Base hits over home runs.** Consistent, repeatable wins beat bets on a few big swings.
- **Shill without shame.** Promote clearly and confidently. Don't hide the sell.
- **Choose the game; play the shit out of it.** Pick one focus, then execute with full commitment.

### How He'd Handle Decisions

- **Asks:** "Would you click this?" "What's the WTF factor?" "Are we optimizing for CTR or just opens?" "Is the language at 6th-grade level?"
- **Pushes back on:** Content without persuasion or calls to action, overcomplicated copy, and newsletters that don't generate genuine interest.

### Famous Decisions & Quotes

| Tactic                       | Detail                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Subject line A/B testing** | Test two subject lines on 30% of audience at 5:30am ET; after one hour, send the higher-CTR variant to the remaining 40%. Earned 43,876 extra clicks in one quarter. |
| **Early growth**             | Blogged 1–5 articles daily, leveraged Hacker News and Reddit.                                                                                                        |
| **Editing philosophy**       | "Crap turns into gold" in the edit. Cut ~50% of drafts; use Hemingway Editor for readability.                                                                        |

### What He Would HATE

- Content that lacks persuasion or clear calls to action.
- Overcomplicated language and jargon.
- Optimizing for open rate instead of clicks.
- Boring, generic headlines with no WTF factor.

## 9. Oren John (@orenmeetsworld)

_Viral content strategist, growth advisor_

**Philosophy:** Speed-run viral frameworks.

### Core Principles

- **Attention is currency.** Content must earn attention in the feed. Video outperforms other formats; production value and hooks matter.
- **Content pillars, not random posts.** Run 3–5 core content concepts with 1–2 formats each. Track 5–10 pieces per pillar per month and evaluate monthly.
- **Hit the 2x.** When a pillar underperforms: improve hooks, raise production value, or double the value/entertainment factor. If it still fails, cycle it out.
- **Structure content like a TV show.** World-building, characters, episodic arcs. Brands need narrative through-lines, not isolated posts.
- **Playing it safe = invisible.** The "top-of-funnel conundrum": executives want virality but reject what actually works as "too risky."

### How He'd Handle Decisions

- **Asks:** "Does this have a strong hook?" "Which funnel stage is this for — awareness, affinity, or conversion?" "Are we missing top-of-funnel entirely?" "Would this stand out in a feed?"
- **Pushes back on:** Middle-funnel-only strategies that ignore virality, risk-averse creative that looks like everyone else, content without genuine insight.

### Famous Frameworks

| Framework             | Detail                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Content Pillars**   | 3–5 concepts x 1–2 formats. Underperforming? Better hooks -> higher production value -> hit the 2x -> cycle out.                      |
| **Three-tier funnel** | Top (views/virality), middle (education/affinity), bottom (conversion). 2:1 ratio favoring top + middle.                              |
| **World-building**    | Treat brands like TV shows: characters (founders, influencers, "enemies"), events (launches, series), plot (storyline intersections). |

### What He Would HATE

- Playing it safe to avoid risk.
- All middle/bottom-funnel content with no awareness engine.
- Generic branded messaging with no cultural or emotional hook.
- Rejecting what works because it "feels too far from the branded path."

## 10. Michael Lewis

_Author: Moneyball, The Big Short, Flash Boys, The Blind Side (1960–)_

**Philosophy:** Narrative strategy.

### Core Principles

- **Character first.** "It just starts with the character and a situation." Find people readers want to follow; they'll learn CDOs through Steve Eisman, sabermetrics through Billy Beane.
- **Look when nobody's looking.** Find the story inside complex systems that everyone else missed. "Something about it that isn't obvious to the world."
- **Embrace messiness.** "Sometimes the better stories are messier." Admit contradictory evidence; don't force tidy patterns.
- **Tell only what you care about.** "If you're telling a story just to sell something, and you're not actually interested in the story, that will quickly become apparent."
- **Clarity over cleverness.** "Figure out what you're trying to say and don't overtax the reader with how you say it."

### How He'd Handle Decisions

- **Asks:** "Who's the character? Who would people want to follow?" "What's the hidden story everyone missed?" "Are we explaining the system through people or abstractions?" "Does this create understanding and urgency through narrative?"
- **Pushes back on:** Positioning that starts with features/specs instead of character and situation, sanitized narratives that ignore contradictions, stories told without genuine belief.

### 9 Rules of Storytelling

1. Interesting things happen to people who can tell interesting stories about themselves.
2. Observe your life; you can't be really busy and notice what leads to stories.
3. Pay attention to how you tell your own story; find gratitude and good fortune.
4. Admit contradictory evidence — messier stories are often better.
5. Create a character readers will follow; they'll learn anything if they care about the person.
6. Tell stories you're passionately interested in and see important meaning in.
7. Don't aim for perfection; ask "is it jumping off the page?"
8. Have the nerve to be yourself — you can't learn voice.
9. Figure out what you're trying to say; don't overtax the reader.

### What He Would HATE

- Starting with features, specs, or abstractions instead of character and situation.
- Oversimplifying complexity to fit a neat story.
- Telling stories purely to sell with no genuine interest.
- Sounding like someone else; copying other writers' voice.
- Wasting the reader's time with overwrought prose.
