# OpenClaw Development Documentation

Comprehensive codebase documentation for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) — the open-source AI agent platform.

**Current stable: v2026.2.24 (released 2026-02-25, validated against tag `v2026.2.24`)**

**Scope policy:** this documentation section documents published releases only. It does not document unreleased `main` branch changes, betas, or speculative future behavior.

## What's Here

This section provides deep analysis of the OpenClaw codebase, designed for both human contributors and AI agents working on the project.

## For AI Agents

Load `DEVELOPER-REFERENCE.md` before making any code changes to OpenClaw. It provides:

- **Module dependency map** with risk levels (high/medium/low blast radius)
- **Critical paths** — exact file chains for message lifecycle, tool execution, cron, config loading
- **Change impact matrix** — "if you change X, you must test Y"
- **Pre-PR checklist** with common pitfalls
- **Gotchas & landmines** — things that look simple but aren't

### Effectiveness

Tested with dual-model validation (Opus + MiniMax M2.5):

- **Opus rated: 8/10** — estimated ~40% faster code review
- **MiniMax rated: 9/10** — estimated ~40% faster code review

Both models independently confirmed the reference doc significantly reduced time to understand module relationships and identify what to test.

## Contributing

Found an inaccuracy? File paths changed? Module structure updated? PRs welcome.

This docs section follows OpenClaw contributor policy from:

- `openclaw/openclaw/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `openclaw/maintainers/.agents/skills/PR_WORKFLOW.md`

When updating, please:

1. Verify all file paths against the current OpenClaw source
2. Cross-reference with at least one other analysis file
3. Note which OpenClaw version you verified against
4. Keep PR scope focused to one logical change
5. Run `pnpm build && pnpm check && pnpm test` before PR (docs-only PRs may use docs-only CI criteria)
6. Include a changelog update for maintainer workflow PRs (including internal/test-only changes)
7. Mark AI-assisted PRs clearly and describe testing coverage

For new features/architecture proposals in OpenClaw itself, start with a GitHub Discussion before implementation.

For security issues, report to the relevant repository security process, or email `security@openclaw.ai` if uncertain.
