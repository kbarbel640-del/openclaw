# Mattermost (plugin)

Status: supported via plugin (bot token + WebSocket events). Channels, groups, and DMs are supported.
Mattermost is a self-hostable team messaging platform; see the official site at
[mattermost.com](https://mattermost.com) for product details and downloads.

## Plugin required

Mattermost ships as a plugin and is not bundled with the core install.

Install via CLI (npm registry):

```bash
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/mattermost
```

Local checkout (when running from a git repo):

```bash
openclaw plugins install ./extensions/mattermost
```

If you choose Mattermost during configure/onboarding and a git checkout is detected,
OpenClaw will offer the local install path automatically.

Details: [Plugins](/tools/plugin)

## Quick setup

1. Install the Mattermost plugin.
2. Create a Mattermost bot account and copy the **bot token**.
3. Copy the Mattermost **base URL** (e.g., `https://chat.example.com`).
4. Configure OpenClaw and start the gateway.

Minimal config:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    mattermost: {
      enabled: true,
      botToken: "mm-token",
      baseUrl: "https://chat.example.com",
      dmPolicy: "pairing",
    },
  },
}
```

## Environment variables (default account)

Set these on the gateway host if you prefer env vars:

- `MATTERMOST_BOT_TOKEN=...`
- `MATTERMOST_URL=https://chat.example.com`

Env vars apply only to the **default** account (`default`). Other accounts must use config values.

## Chat modes

Mattermost responds to DMs automatically. Channel behavior is controlled by `chatmode`:

- `oncall` (default): respond only when @mentioned in channels.
- `onmessage`: respond to every channel message.
- `onchar`: respond when a message starts with a trigger prefix.

Config example:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    mattermost: {
      chatmode: "onchar",
      oncharPrefixes: [">", "!"],
    },
  },
}
```

Notes:

- `onchar` still responds to explicit @mentions.
- `channels.mattermost.requireMention` is honored for legacy configs but `chatmode` is preferred.

## Access control (DMs)

- Default: `channels.mattermost.dmPolicy = "pairing"` (unknown senders get a pairing code).
- Approve via:
  - `openclaw pairing list mattermost`
  - `openclaw pairing approve mattermost <CODE>`
- Public DMs: `channels.mattermost.dmPolicy="open"` plus `channels.mattermost.allowFrom=["*"]`.

## Channels (groups)

- Default: `channels.mattermost.groupPolicy = "allowlist"` (mention-gated).
- Allowlist senders with `channels.mattermost.groupAllowFrom` (user IDs recommended).
- `@username` matching is mutable and only enabled when `channels.mattermost.dangerouslyAllowNameMatching: true`.
- Open channels: `channels.mattermost.groupPolicy="open"` (mention-gated).
- Runtime note: if `channels.mattermost` is completely missing, runtime falls back to `groupPolicy="allowlist"` for group checks (even if `channels.defaults.groupPolicy` is set).

## Targets for outbound delivery

Use these target formats with `openclaw message send` or cron/webhooks:

- `channel:<id>` for a channel
- `user:<id>` for a DM
- `@username` for a DM (resolved via the Mattermost API)

Bare IDs are treated as channels.

## Reactions (message tool)

- Use `message action=react` with `channel=mattermost`.
- `messageId` is the Mattermost post id.
- `emoji` accepts names like `thumbsup` or `:+1:` (colons are optional).
- Set `remove=true` (boolean) to remove a reaction.
- Reaction add/remove events are forwarded as system events to the routed agent session.

Examples:

```
message action=react channel=mattermost target=channel:<channelId> messageId=<postId> emoji=thumbsup
message action=react channel=mattermost target=channel:<channelId> messageId=<postId> emoji=thumbsup remove=true
```

Config:

- `channels.mattermost.actions.reactions`: enable/disable reaction actions (default true).
- Per-account override: `channels.mattermost.accounts.<id>.actions.reactions`.

## Interactive buttons (message tool)

Send messages with clickable buttons. When a user clicks a button, the agent receives the
selection and can respond.

Enable buttons by adding `inlineButtons` to the channel capabilities:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    mattermost: {
      capabilities: ["inlineButtons"],
    },
  },
}
```

Use `message action=send` with a `buttons` parameter. Buttons are a 2D array (rows of buttons):

```
message action=send channel=mattermost target=channel:<channelId> buttons=[[{"text":"Yes","callback_data":"yes"},{"text":"No","callback_data":"no"}]]
```

Button fields:

- `text` (required): display label.
- `callback_data` (required): value sent back on click (used as the action ID).
- `style` (optional): `"default"`, `"primary"`, or `"danger"`.

When a user clicks a button:

1. All buttons are replaced with a confirmation line (e.g., "✓ **Yes** selected by @user").
2. The agent receives the selection as an inbound message and responds.

Notes:

- Button callbacks use HMAC-SHA256 verification (automatic, no config needed).
- Mattermost strips callback data from its API responses (security feature), so all buttons
  are removed on click — partial removal is not possible.
- Action IDs containing hyphens or underscores are sanitized automatically
  (Mattermost routing limitation).

Config:

- `channels.mattermost.capabilities`: array of capability strings. Add `"inlineButtons"` to
  enable the buttons tool description in the agent system prompt.

### Direct API integration (external scripts)

External scripts and webhooks can post buttons directly via the Mattermost REST API
instead of going through the agent's `message` tool. Use `buildButtonAttachments()` from
the extension when possible; if posting raw JSON, follow these rules:

**Payload structure:**

```json5
{
  channel_id: "<channelId>",
  message: "Choose an option:",
  props: {
    attachments: [
      {
        actions: [
          {
            id: "mybutton01", // alphanumeric only — see below
            type: "button", // required, or clicks are silently ignored
            name: "Approve", // display label
            style: "primary", // optional: "default", "primary", "danger"
            integration: {
              url: "http://localhost:18789/mattermost/interactions/default",
              context: {
                action_id: "mybutton01", // must match button id (for name lookup)
                action: "approve",
                // ... any custom fields ...
                _token: "<hmac>", // see HMAC section below
              },
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

**Critical rules:**

1. Attachments go in `props.attachments`, not top-level `attachments` (silently ignored).
2. Every action needs `type: "button"` — without it, clicks are swallowed silently.
3. Every action needs an `id` field — Mattermost ignores actions without IDs.
4. Action `id` must be **alphanumeric only** (`[a-zA-Z0-9]`). Hyphens and underscores break
   Mattermost's server-side action routing (returns 404). Strip them before use.
5. `context.action_id` must match the button's `id` so the confirmation message shows the
   button name (e.g., "Approve") instead of a raw ID.
6. `context.action_id` is required — the interaction handler returns 400 without it.

**HMAC token generation:**

The gateway verifies button clicks with HMAC-SHA256. External scripts must generate tokens
that match the gateway's verification logic:

1. Derive the secret from the bot token:
   `HMAC-SHA256(key="openclaw-mattermost-interactions", data=botToken)`
2. Build the context object with all fields **except** `_token`.
3. Serialize with **sorted keys** and **no spaces** (the gateway uses `JSON.stringify`
   with sorted keys, which produces compact output).
4. Sign: `HMAC-SHA256(key=secret, data=serializedContext)`
5. Add the resulting hex digest as `_token` in the context.

Python example:

```python
import hmac, hashlib, json

secret = hmac.new(
    b"openclaw-mattermost-interactions",
    bot_token.encode(), hashlib.sha256
).hexdigest()

ctx = {"action_id": "mybutton01", "action": "approve"}
payload = json.dumps(ctx, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"))
token = hmac.new(secret.encode(), payload.encode(), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()

context = {**ctx, "_token": token}
```

Common HMAC pitfalls:

- Python's `json.dumps` adds spaces by default (`{"key": "val"}`). Use
  `separators=(",", ":")` to match JavaScript's compact output (`{"key":"val"}`).
- Always sign **all** context fields (minus `_token`). The gateway strips `_token` then
  signs everything remaining. Signing a subset causes silent verification failure.
- Use `sort_keys=True` — the gateway sorts keys before signing, and Mattermost may
  reorder context fields when storing the payload.
- Derive the secret from the bot token (deterministic), not random bytes. The secret
  must be the same across the process that creates buttons and the gateway that verifies.

## Directory adapter

The Mattermost plugin includes a directory adapter that resolves channel and user names
via the Mattermost API. This enables `#channel-name` and `@username` targets in
`openclaw message send` and cron/webhook deliveries.

No configuration is needed — the adapter uses the bot token from the account config.

## Multi-account

Mattermost supports multiple accounts under `channels.mattermost.accounts`:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    mattermost: {
      accounts: {
        default: { name: "Primary", botToken: "mm-token", baseUrl: "https://chat.example.com" },
        alerts: { name: "Alerts", botToken: "mm-token-2", baseUrl: "https://alerts.example.com" },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- No replies in channels: ensure the bot is in the channel and mention it (oncall), use a trigger prefix (onchar), or set `chatmode: "onmessage"`.
- Auth errors: check the bot token, base URL, and whether the account is enabled.
- Multi-account issues: env vars only apply to the `default` account.
- Buttons appear as white boxes: the agent may be sending malformed button data. Check that each button has both `text` and `callback_data` fields.
- Buttons render but clicks do nothing: verify `AllowedUntrustedInternalConnections` in Mattermost server config includes `127.0.0.1 localhost`, and that `EnablePostActionIntegration` is `true` in ServiceSettings.
- Buttons return 404 on click: the button `id` likely contains hyphens or underscores. Mattermost's action router breaks on non-alphanumeric IDs. Use `[a-zA-Z0-9]` only.
- Gateway logs `invalid _token`: HMAC mismatch. Check that you sign all context fields (not a subset), use sorted keys, and use compact JSON (no spaces). See the HMAC section above.
- Gateway logs `missing _token in context`: the `_token` field is not in the button's context. Ensure it is included when building the integration payload.
- Confirmation shows raw ID instead of button name: `context.action_id` does not match the button's `id`. Set both to the same sanitized value.
- Agent doesn't know about buttons: add `capabilities: ["inlineButtons"]` to the Mattermost channel config.
