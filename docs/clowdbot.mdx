Deploy OpenClaw on [clowd.bot](https://clowd.bot) with built-in LLM access. No API keys required.

## Pricing

- One-time launch fee (no recurring hosting costs)
- Pay-as-you-go LLM usage via [ATXP](https://accounts.atxp.ai), which provides access to all frontier models

ATXP accounts include onboarding credits, so initial usage is free.

## Prerequisites

Create an [ATXP account](https://accounts.atxp.ai) before launching. This is used for pay-as-you-go LLM billing.

## Launch

1. Go to [clowd.bot](https://clowd.bot).
2. Sign in with your ATXP account.
3. Click to launch a new instance.

## Onboarding

After launch, you are presented with a browser-based terminal running `openclaw onboarding`. This guides you through initial configuration:

- Setting up chat channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc.)
- Configuring your agent

Once onboarding completes, the admin view links to the Control UI.

## What you get

- Hosted OpenClaw Gateway
- Control UI
- Persistent storage (abstracted)
- Browser-based terminal access
- Built-in LLM access (no API keys to manage)
