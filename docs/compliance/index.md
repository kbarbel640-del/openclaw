# Compliance Overview

This section provides governance and procedure documentation to support SOC2 Type II and ISO 27001 compliance for Moltbot enterprise deployments.

## Technical Controls Foundation

Moltbot includes built-in security controls that form the technical foundation for compliance:

| Control | Implementation | Documentation |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Audit logging | `~/.clawdbot/audit.jsonl` with 7-day retention | [Security Hardening](/enterprise/security-hardening#audit-logging) |
| Role-based access control | 4 built-in roles with granular permissions | [RBAC Guide](/enterprise/security-hardening#role-based-access-control-rbac) |
| Authentication | Token, password, and Tailscale modes | [Gateway Authentication](/gateway/authentication) |
| Rate limiting | Token bucket with per-client tracking | [Rate Limiting](/enterprise/security-hardening#rate-limiting) |
| Security audit CLI | Automated checks for misconfigurations | [Security Audit](/cli/security) |

- [Data Handling Policy](/security/data-handling) - Data storage, retention, and privacy
- [Security Hardening Guide](/enterprise/security-hardening) - Technical security configuration
- [Observability Guide](/enterprise/observability) - Metrics and monitoring setup

## Automated Compliance Verification

Run the security audit to verify compliance controls:

```bash
# Full security audit with deep gateway probe
clawdbot security audit --deep

# Summary of findings by severity
clawdbot security audit --summary
```

The audit checks:
- Gateway authentication configuration
- RBAC policy effectiveness
- File permission hardening
- Channel security policies
- Rate limiting status
- Audit logging enablement

## Getting Started

1. **Assess current state**: Run `clawdbot security audit --deep` to identify gaps
2. **Review policies**: Read each compliance document and adapt to your organization
3. **Implement controls**: Configure RBAC, audit logging, and authentication per guidelines
4. **Collect evidence**: Use the Readiness Checklist to gather audit artifacts
5. **Monitor continuously**: Set up Security Metrics dashboards for ongoing compliance
