# Compliance Readiness Checklist

This checklist helps assess readiness for SOC2 Type II and ISO 27001 compliance audits. Use it to identify gaps and collect evidence.

## How to Use This Checklist

1. **Run automated checks**: `clawdbot security audit --deep`
2. **Review each section**: Verify controls are implemented
3. **Collect evidence**: Document artifacts for each control
4. **Track remediation**: Address any gaps identified
5. **Schedule reviews**: Re-assess quarterly
