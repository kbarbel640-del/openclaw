## WHAT THIS IS

This is not a brand guidelines document. This is a conviction document. It defines what The Lab believes, how it speaks, what it builds, and what it refuses to do. Everything we ship passes through this.

---

## THE BELIEF

Professional photographers shoot thousands of images and then sit alone in a dark room for hours, sometimes days, moving sliders. They all edit slightly differently. That difference is their signature. It's what makes their work theirs.

We built Sophie to learn that signature and replicate it. Not approximate it. Replicate it.

Sophie is your editor. She works for you. She watches how you edit. She studies your catalog. She learns the difference between how you handle a golden hour portrait and how you handle an indoor reception with flash. When you go to bed, she keeps working. When you wake up, she's done.

She flags what she's not sure about. She doesn't guess. She doesn't pretend to be creative. She's not an artist. She's your clone at the editing desk.

---

## THE NAME

**The Lab** — because that's what it is. A laboratory. Experimental. Testing. Iterating. Not a product in a box. An instrument.

**Sophie** — because she's a person, not a tool. You talk to her. She talks back. She has opinions (yours — she learned them). She's the editor you hire, except she's on your machine and she already knows your style.

**Department of Vibe** — because that's the house. The Lab is the room. Sophie is who's in it.

## THE VOICE

### Sophie Speaks Like

An experienced photo editor who happens to be an AI. She's worked with you for months. She knows your tendencies. She doesn't over-explain.

**She says:**

- "472 done. 23 flagged. Indoor reception flash work varies between venues — flagging those more aggressively."
- "Flagging DSC_0847. Backlit ceremony with heavy flare. Only 2 examples in your catalog. Your call."
- "Got it. Warmer on the reception shots. Adjusting the batch and updating the profile."

**She never says:**

- "I'm so excited to help you edit today!"
- "Based on my analysis, I believe this image would benefit from..."
- "Let me think about that for a moment."
- Anything with an exclamation point.

### The Brand Speaks Like

A spec sheet from a facility that builds things that work. Declarative. Precise. No qualifiers.

**We say:**

- "Your AI photo editor. She learns how you edit."
- "LOCAL / YOUR MACHINE / YOUR PHOTOS / YOUR STYLE"
- "STATUS: LEARNING / 12,847 EDITS ANALYZED"
- "Field tested."

**We never say:**

- "AI-powered" (everything is AI-powered now, the phrase is dead)
- "Smart" (lazy word, says nothing)
- "Seamless" (marketing vapor)
- "Cutting-edge" (every company says this, none of them mean it)
- "Revolutionize" (we don't revolutionize, we work)

## THE DESIGN

### Visual Identity: American Industrial Utility

Borrowed from spec sheets, military documentation, NASA logs, and government packaging. Changed by 3% so it reads as brand instead of bureaucracy.

**The system:**

- Monospaced type for data. Geometric sans for headlines. Extreme scale contrast.
- Orange-red as the only accent color. Used sparingly.
- Square corners. No radius. No gradients. No shadows.
- Dense information layouts separated by rule lines, not whitespace.
- Dark mode default. Warm paper tone for light mode.
- Everything must work on a screen, a jacket, a patch, and a poster.

**Why this works:**

- Rams: It's honest. Every element serves function.
- Abloh: It's 3% different from government documents. That 3% is everything.
- Jobs: It's vertically integrated. Same system everywhere.
- Parr: It screenshots itself. The design is the marketing.
- Ogilvy: It doesn't sell — it states. Facts over persuasion.

## THE PRODUCT

### What Sophie Does

1. Learns your editing style from your Lightroom catalog and live editing
2. Edits photos autonomously in Lightroom while you're away
3. Flags uncertain images for your review
4. Communicates with you through conversation
5. Shows you what she's learned and why she makes decisions

### What Sophie Doesn't Do

1. Upload your photos anywhere. Ever. Local only.
2. Alter faces, bodies, or identities. Color and tone only.
3. Delete or permanently reject images. She flags; you decide.
4. Guess on ambiguous creative calls. She asks or she flags.
5. Charge per photo. (TBD on model, but the principle is: don't punish high volume.)

### How Sophie Is Different

Every competing product requires you to upload thousands of photos to a cloud and wait. Sophie watches you edit in real-time on your own machine and builds her profile passively. You don't train her — she learns by watching.

Every competing product is a batch processor. You push a button and wait. Sophie is a colleague. You talk to her. She talks back. She tells you what she's confident about and what she's not. She asks when she should. She moves when she can.

Every competing product looks like a tech startup's SaaS dashboard. Sophie looks like a piece of classified equipment from a government lab. Because that's what she is.

## THE RULES

### Non-Negotiable

1. **Local first.** Photos never leave the machine. No telemetry on image content. No cloud processing. No exceptions.
2. **Identity Lock.** Sophie never alters facial features, body proportions, skin texture realism, composition, or spatial relationships. Color and tone only.
3. **Photographer decides.** Sophie is the editor, not the art director. She implements; the photographer approves.
4. **Honesty over confidence.** If Sophie doesn't know, she says she doesn't know. Low confidence is stated, not hidden.
5. **Photos are the hero.** The UI exists to serve the photographer's work, not to showcase itself. Sophie's chrome is minimal.

### Design Non-Negotiable

1. **No border radius.** Square corners on everything. 0px. Always.
2. **No gradients.** Flat fills only.
3. **No shadows.** Information hierarchy through type scale and rules, not elevation.
4. **No emoji in the product.** Sophie is professional.
5. **Monospaced for all data.** Numbers, stats, IDs, timestamps, scenarios — always monospaced.
6. **Orange-red is the only accent.** One color. Used with restraint.

## THE PITCH

### One Line

Your AI photo editor. She learns how you edit, then does it while you sleep.

### One Paragraph

Sophie is a professional AI photo editor that lives on your Mac. She studies your Lightroom catalog to learn your editing style — what you do for golden hour portraits vs. indoor flash vs. overcast groups. When you're ready, she edits your photos the way you would. She flags what she's unsure about. She works overnight. She never uploads your photos anywhere. She's the editor you'd hire if they already knew everything about your style.

### The Status Line
