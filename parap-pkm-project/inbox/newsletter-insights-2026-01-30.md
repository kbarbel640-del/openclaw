## High-Value Extracts

### AI Corner: Psychological Prompting Framework
**Source:** The AI Corner - "The Psychology Trick That Makes AI Output 10x Better"
**Relevance:** Directly applicable to how we work with LLMs

**Key Insight:**
Framing feedback as "this doesn't match your usual quality" triggers higher-quality response patterns vs "you're wrong" which triggers defensive reformatting.

**The Pattern (Rejection Sampling Through Framing):**
| Instead of | Say |
|------------|-----|
| "This is wrong" | "This doesn't match your usual quality. What would your best version look like?" |
| "This is too generic" | "This feels off-brand for you. Can you make it sharper?" |
| "You missed something" | "Claude usually catches nuances like this. What am I missing?" |
| Accepting bad output | "Rate how well that response followed my instructions, 1-10, and explain your reasoning." |

**Why it works:** LLMs trained on human interactions learned that certain feedback types precede higher-quality outputs. Your framing selects which response distribution the model samples from.

**Source:** Product Growth - "The AI Product Success Metrics Interview: Your Complete Guide"
**Relevance:** If pursuing AI PM roles

**Interview Rubric (what hiring managers evaluate):**
1. **Structured problem approach (15%)** - Custom framework, easy to follow
2. **Metric selection & rationale (25%)** - Strong hierarchy addressing gaming
3. **Measurement & implementation (20%)** - Show exactly how you'll operationalize
4. **Tradeoffs & risks (15%)** - Deep tradeoff analysis
5. **AI-specific understanding (25%)** - AI metrics fluency (offline evals, non-determinism, latency vs quality, model drift)

**AI-specific considerations:**
- Offline evals required
- Non-deterministic nature of AI
- Latency vs output quality balance
- Model drift over time

### Nate's Substack: AI Market Consolidation (Week of Jan 26)
**Source:** Nate's Newsletter - "20 hours of news in 10 minutes"
**Relevance:** Strategic awareness for AI/tech landscape

**Story 1: Meta vs Microsoft Divergence**
- Meta: $135B capex (nearly doubling from $72B), stock +10%
- Microsoft: 45% of $625B commercial backlog tied to OpenAI commitments, stock -10%
- **Lesson:** Market prices "owning AI capabilities" vs "renting from unproven labs"

**Story 2: Waymo Accountability Crisis**
- Child collision near Santa Monica school → NHTSA investigation
- 19 school bus violations in Austin (post-recall update)
- **Lesson:** Autonomous systems compete against public tolerance, not statistics

**Story 3: Infrastructure Arms Race**
- Nvidia invested $2B in CoreWeave → 5 gigawatts AI data center capacity by 2030
- Microsoft $750M deal with Perplexity for multi-model access
- **Lesson:** Second wave of AI spending going to deployment infrastructure

**Story 4: Tesla Pivot**
- Discontinuing Model S/X by Q2 2026
- Converting Fremont lines to produce 1M Optimus robots/year
- $2B investment in xAI, Grok deployed across Tesla fleet
- **Lesson:** Category boundaries collapsing — Tesla now "AI/robotics company that sells cars"

**Story 5: OpenClaw Explosion**
- Weekend project → 100k GitHub stars in 2 months
- 2M visitors in 7 days
- **Lesson:** Demand for local-first autonomous agents is massive (and risky)

**Meta-theme:** The abstraction phase is ending. Irreversible commitments are being locked in.
