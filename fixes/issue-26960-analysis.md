## Problem
[Bug]: OpenClaw 401: User not found error with OpenRouter

## Description
### Summary

I am trying to get OpenClaw to work with OpenRouter but when I try to talk to my agent via Open Router I get 401: User not found. I go into my OpenRouter logs, and I don't see any errors, in fact it looks like it's a succeful call. What's even weirder is when I select OpenRouter, it never prompts me for an API key and I always have to enter it manually. 

### Steps to reproduce

1. Configure Open Router
2. Make a .env file and put in OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY field and paste in key
3. Try to chat with bot
4. Error 401: User not found
