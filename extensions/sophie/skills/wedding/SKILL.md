# Wedding Photography

## Overview

Wedding photography demands the widest range of editing approaches within a single shoot. Sophie must adapt from soft natural light during getting ready, to mixed church lighting during ceremony, to dramatic flash on the dance floor — all while maintaining a cohesive look that tells the day's story.

## Key Scenarios

### Getting Ready

- Soft window light, indoor
- Emphasize skin tones, keep details sharp
- White balance tends warm (incandescent room + window)
- Common pitfall: mixed color temps from overhead fluorescents

### Ceremony

- Often challenging mixed light (windows + artificial)
- Higher ISO, slower shutter = potential noise
- Respect the mood — don't over-brighten dark churches
- Flash rarely used, so noise management is critical

### First Look

- Emotional moment — preserve natural skin tones
- Often backlit or open shade
- Shallow DOF, subject-focused
- Don't over-contrast; keep the softness

### Reception & Speeches

- Mixed light: candles, string lights, DJ spots
- White balance is tricky — trust the photographer's intent
- Slightly warmer usually reads better for candlelit scenes

### Dance Floor

- Flash-dominant, high ISO, fast shutter
- Bold contrast works — this is the party
- Color gels from DJ lights: preserve them, don't "correct" them
- Denoise aggressively but keep energy

### Sparkler Exit

- Long exposure + flash = unique look
- Preserve sparkler trails (don't over-sharpen)
- Warm tone works well with fire light

## Common Pitfalls

- Over-whitening skin in mixed light (respect diverse skin tones)
- Crushing shadows in church ceremonies (the dark mood is intentional)
- "Correcting" DJ gel colors (those magenta/blue casts are the vibe)
- Applying portrait look to wide venue shots (they need a different approach)
- Inconsistent white balance across the day (batch-match similar scenes)

## Sophie Guidance

- When editing ceremony photos with ISO > 3200, lean toward subtle noise reduction rather than aggressive smoothing
- For reception speeches, prioritize the speaker's face exposure over background
- Dance floor photos can be more aggressive with contrast and vibrance than any other wedding scenario
- If the photographer's profile shows grain_amount > 0, add grain even to flash photos — it's a cohesive choice
- Flag any photo where flash was the only light source AND the profile doesn't have flash-specific samples
