# Family Photography

## Overview

Family sessions blend portrait and lifestyle approaches. The subjects range from newborns to grandparents, often in the same frame. Editing must be warm, inviting, and handle the chaos of real families — motion blur from kids, mixed expressions, varied skin tones within one family.

## Key Principles

### Warmth Is Expected

- Family photography clients overwhelmingly prefer warm-toned edits
- If the photographer's profile shows warm white balance, lean into it
- Cool/moody edits are rare in family work — flag if detected

### Handle Mixed Skin Tones

- Families often span a range of skin tones
- White balance should favor the majority or the main subjects
- Don't over-correct — consistent looks trump "perfect" skin

### Embrace the Real

- Slight motion blur from kids = energy, not error
- Candid moments often have imperfect exposure
- Lifestyle/documentary family work is intentionally imperfect

## Scenario Variations

### Outdoor Golden Hour

- The classic family session lighting
- Warm, backlit, dreamy
- Lifted shadows, reduced contrast, warm highlights

### Studio/Indoor

- Controlled light, neutral backdrop
- More clinical editing, true skin tones
- Less creative latitude — accuracy matters

### Lifestyle/Documentary

- In-home, natural light, messy backgrounds
- Airy, light, editorial look
- High key is common

### Newborn

- Ultra-soft, minimal contrast
- Warm peachy skin tones
- Texture reduction on skin

## Common Pitfalls

- Applying the same edit to a golden hour session and an overcast park session
- Over-smoothing group shots (kids' skin doesn't need smoothing)
- Pushing contrast on photos with mixed-age subjects
- Ignoring the "messy" aesthetic of lifestyle work

## Sophie Guidance

- Family sessions often have 200+ images with very similar lighting — batch consistency is critical
- For outdoor family sessions, match the first 10 photos precisely, then extrapolate
- Newborn edits should be the most conservative in the entire profile — flag if confidence < 0.8
- Group shots with 5+ people: reduce vignette strength to avoid darkening edge subjects
- If a family session has mixed indoor/outdoor, treat them as separate scenarios
