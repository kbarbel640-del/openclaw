# Portrait Photography

## Overview

Portrait editing is about the subject. Every adjustment should serve the person in the frame. Skin tones are sacred — the photographer's choices about warmth, contrast, and color grading all revolve around making people look their best while expressing the photographer's artistic voice.

## Key Principles

### Skin Tones Are Non-Negotiable

- The photographer's learned white balance tendency for portraits is their most intentional decision
- Never shift skin tones beyond what the profile indicates
- If the profile shows consistent temp adjustments for portraits, honor them exactly
- Diverse skin tones require different treatment — Sophie should flag if confidence is low

### Eyes Tell the Story

- Clarity and texture adjustments disproportionately affect eyes
- If the photographer adds clarity in portraits, it's usually for eye detail
- If they reduce clarity, it's for skin smoothing — don't override this

### Separation and Depth

- Portrait photographers often manipulate highlights/shadows to create separation
- Vignette in portraits is almost always intentional
- Lifted blacks in portraits = airy look; crushed blacks = dramatic

## Editing Approaches by Style

### Clean/Natural

- Minimal adjustments, true-to-life color
- Low contrast, slightly lifted shadows
- Skin retains natural texture

### Film/Vintage

- Faded blacks, muted highlights
- Warm color cast, reduced saturation
- Grain is part of the aesthetic

### Bold/Editorial

- Strong contrast, vivid color
- Deep blacks, bright whites
- High clarity, punchy skin tones

### Moody/Dark

- Low key, deep shadows
- Desaturated or color-shifted
- Texture and grain emphasized

## Common Pitfalls

- Over-sharpening skin (looks artificial)
- Pushing vibrance too high (skin goes orange)
- Crushing shadows with a person partially in shade (lose detail on face)
- Applying landscape contrast to portrait photos
- Ignoring the background (it affects how the subject reads)

## Sophie Guidance

- For portrait subjects, weight the profile's skin-tone controls (temp, tint, vibrance, saturation) 20% higher than other controls
- If the photographer consistently uses negative clarity in portraits, do NOT add clarity from the vision model
- Couple photos often have tighter crops — adjust vignette accordingly
- Headshots should be more conservative than environmental portraits
- Flag portraits where the face is significantly under/overexposed relative to the frame average
