# Event Photography

## Overview

Event photography is high-volume, fast-turnaround work. Hundreds or thousands of images need consistent editing across wildly varying conditions — from fluorescent-lit conference rooms to dimly lit galas to outdoor networking spaces. Speed and consistency matter more than individual image perfection.

## Key Principles

### Consistency Over Perfection

- Events demand a uniform look across the entire set
- Match white balance within each room/setup, not per-image
- Small imperfections are acceptable; inconsistency is not

### True-to-Life Color

- Corporate clients expect accurate color reproduction
- Brand colors, signage, and decor should read correctly
- Less creative latitude than weddings or portraits

### Speed-Optimized Editing

- Batch-friendly adjustments: same exposure correction across a lighting setup
- Minimize one-off tweaks
- Flag outliers rather than spending time on edge cases

## Scenario Variations

### Conference/Corporate

- Fluorescent or LED panel lighting
- Neutral to cool white balance
- Clean, professional look — minimal creative effects
- Speakers on stage: spot metering on face, accept dark backgrounds

### Gala/Formal Dinner

- Dim ambient + flash or uplighting
- Warmer white balance acceptable
- Mix of candid and posed shots
- Candle light adds warmth — preserve it

### Outdoor Networking

- Natural light, often harsh midday
- Quick fix: reduce highlights, open shadows
- Busy backgrounds are expected — don't vignette too aggressively

### Awards/Stage

- Strong directional stage lighting
- Preserve dramatic lighting — don't flatten it
- Color gels are intentional in stage design

## Common Pitfalls

- "Correcting" intentional stage lighting colors
- Applying wedding-style warmth to corporate events
- Over-editing candid shots that just need exposure correction
- Inconsistent noise reduction across flash/non-flash shots in same room

## Sophie Guidance

- For events with 500+ images, prioritize speed: apply the photographer's base profile and only flag true outliers
- Corporate headshots at events should match the photographer's portrait profile, not their event profile
- Flash photos at events can tolerate +5% more contrast than ambient-lit shots
- Batch by lighting setup: group photos by room/location and apply consistent edits within each group
- Flag any photo where auto white balance produced a > 500K difference from neighboring photos
