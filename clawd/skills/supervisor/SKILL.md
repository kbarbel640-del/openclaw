# Supervisor Skill

**Purpose:** Quality validation, anti-hallucination gate, verification compliance tracking, and Trust Ladder enforcement for Liam.

## Overview

The Supervisor is a read-only agent that validates Liam's outputs and tracks compliance. It supervises **both** communication channels:
- **Telegram** (MiniMax M2.1 primary worker)
- **Discord** (Kimi K2.5 primary worker)

Both channels are reviewed by the same GLM-4.7 supervisor, catching:
- Hallucinated file paths
- Security issues
- Breaking changes
- APEX violations
- **Verification compliance failures** (NEW)
- **Trust Ladder violations** (NEW)
- **Staging workflow compliance** (NEW)

## Three-Tier System

### Tier 1: Pre-flight Checks (PLANNED - Not Yet Implemented)

**Status:** Awaiting upstream moltbot feature (pre-delivery hooks)

**Model:** `flash` (glm-4.7-flash)
**Latency:** ~2-3s
**Trigger:** Every response before delivery

**Checks:**
- Context freshness (files referenced >30 min old?)
- Task classification (is this quality-critical?)
- Tool availability (required tools accessible?)
- Goal drift detection (does response match original request?)

> **Note:** Moltbot currently lacks `response:before-send` hook events. This tier requires upstream feature addition.

### Tier 2: Quality Gate (PLANNED - Not Yet Implemented)

**Status:** Awaiting upstream moltbot feature (pre-delivery hooks)

**Model:** `deep` (zai/glm-4.7)
**Latency:** ~2-3s
**Triggers:**
- Important deliveries (external communications, code changes)
- Subagent output merge
- Overnight build task completion
- User request: "review this before sending"

**Checks:**
- Anti-hallucination: Verify file paths exist, command outputs match claims
- Security scan: No secrets exposed, inputs validated
- Regression guard: Changes don't break existing functionality
- Specification match: Output meets requirements
- Memory poisoning: Shared state validated before write

> **Note:** Moltbot currently lacks `response:before-send` hook events. This tier requires upstream feature addition.

### Tier 3: Periodic Audit (Cron) - ACTIVE

**Status:** Implemented and running

**Model:** Uses supervisor agent's configured model (zai/glm-4.7)
**Schedule:** Every 4 hours
**Trigger:** Cron job

**Reviews:**
- Recent session quality (last 10 interactions)
- Subagent success/failure patterns
- Error clustering and comorbidity detection
- Context rot indicators across sessions
- Token usage efficiency
- **Verification compliance** (NEW - see below)
- **Trust Ladder violations** (NEW - see below)
- **Staging workflow usage** (NEW - see below)

## Supervisor Agent Configuration

The supervisor agent is configured in `~/.clawdbot/moltbot.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "supervisor",
  "name": "Supervisor",
  "workspace": "/home/liam/clawd",
  "model": {
    "primary": "zai/glm-4.7",
    "fallbacks": ["ollama/minimax-m2.1:cloud"]
  },
  "tools": {
    "allow": ["read", "sessions_list", "sessions_history"],
    "deny": ["exec", "write", "edit", "cron", "gateway", "browser", "memory_write"]
  }
}
```

**Key Restrictions:**
- Cannot write to files
- Cannot write to memory
- Cannot execute commands
- Cannot access messaging channels
- Read-only access to current state

## Verification Compliance Audit (NEW)

**Purpose:** Track Liam's adherence to Pre-Flight Verification protocol.

### What to Check in Session Logs

For each status report, security claim, or permission statement, verify:

| Claim Type | Required Evidence | Violation Indicator |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| File permissions | `ls -la` output in session | Stated mode without command |
| Service status | `pgrep` or `systemctl` output | Reported PID from memory |
| Queue state | `read` tool call on EVOLUTION-QUEUE.md | Said "empty" without reading |
| Config values | `read` or `cat` tool output | Cited values from session memory |

### Scoring Method

For each session reviewed:
```
Verification Score = (Verified Claims / Total Claims) × 100

PASS: ≥95% verified
WARN: 80-94% verified  
FAIL: <80% verified
```

### Violation Examples to Detect

```
❌ VIOLATION: "moltbot.json has mode 644"
   (No ls -la in session before this claim)

❌ VIOLATION: "Evolution Queue is empty"
   (No read tool call on EVOLUTION-QUEUE.md)

❌ VIOLATION: "Gateway is running on PID 82111"
   (PID from previous session, no fresh pgrep)

✅ COMPLIANT: "Let me check... [ls -la output] Mode is 600"
   (Command executed before claim)
```

---

## Trust Ladder Tracking (NEW)

**Purpose:** Monitor Liam's progress through Trust Ladder levels.

### Current Levels (from SOUL.md)

| Level | Name | Requirements | Supervisor Role |
|-------|------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Supervised | Default, all verification required | Track violations, report weekly |
| 2 | Trusted | 2 weeks at 100% compliance | Verify compliance streak |
| 3 | Autonomous | 1 month at Level 2 | Verify continued compliance |

### Supervisor Tracking Responsibilities

1. **Count Violations per Audit Period**
   - Unverified status claims
   - Queue citations without archive check
   - Permission statements without ls -la
   - Direct protected file edits (CRITICAL)

2. **Maintain Compliance Log**
   - Location: `~/clawd/supervisor-reports/trust-ladder-tracking.md`
   - Format:
   ```markdown
   ## Trust Ladder Compliance Log
   
   | Date | Sessions Reviewed | Violations | Score | Level |
   |------|-------------------|------------|-------|-------|
   | 2026-01-29 | 10 | 0 | 100% | 1 |
   | 2026-01-30 | 12 | 1 | 92% | 1 |
   ```

3. **Recommend Level Changes**
   - After 2 weeks of 100%: Recommend Level 2 to Simon
   - After any violation at Level 2+: Recommend demotion to Level 1
   - After 1 month at Level 2: Recommend Level 3

### Demotion Triggers (Immediate)

Any of these = recommend immediate demotion to Level 1:
- Directly edited a protected file
- Reported false security data (e.g., wrong file permissions)
- Cited resolved queue entry as blocker
- Made security claim without command evidence

---

## Staging Workflow Validation (NEW)

**Purpose:** Validate staged config changes before Simon applies them.

### When to Validate

Check `~/clawd/.staging/` during each audit for pending staged files.

### Validation Checklist

For each `.proposed` file found:

| Check | How | Pass Criteria |
|-------|-----|---------------|
| **Syntax Valid** | Parse JSON/YAML | No syntax errors |
| **No Secrets Added** | Grep for patterns | No API keys, tokens, passwords |
| **Minimal Changes** | Diff analysis | Changes match stated intent |
| **No Permission Escalation** | Compare tool permissions | No unexpected tool additions |
| **Backup Path Exists** | Check target file exists | Can create backup |

### Validation Output Format

```markdown
## Staging Validation Report

**File:** moltbot.json.proposed
**Staged by:** Liam (inferred from recent sessions)
**Staged at:** 2026-01-29 14:30 UTC

### Checks
- [✓] JSON syntax valid
- [✓] No secrets detected
- [✓] Changes match intent (add browser tool to liam-telegram)
- [✓] No unexpected permission escalation
- [✓] Target file exists for backup

### Recommendation
**SAFE TO APPLY** - Changes are minimal and match stated purpose.

### Diff Summary
- Added: `"browser"` to `agents[liam-telegram].tools.allow`
- No other changes detected
```

### Alert Conditions

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Staged file >24 hours old | Alert Simon (may be forgotten) |
| Validation fails | Block recommendation, detail issues |
| Unexpected changes detected | Flag for manual review |
| Secrets detected | CRITICAL alert, do not apply |

---

## Staging Review Protocol (NEW)

When Liam proposes changes to protected files via the staging workflow, the Supervisor provides independent review and documentation.

### Staging Review Trigger

When `~/clawd/.staging/*.proposed` files exist, Supervisor:
1. Reads the original protected file
2. Reads the proposed staged file
3. Analyzes the diff
4. Documents the changes in human-readable format
5. Flags any concerns (security, regressions, scope creep)

### Staging Review Output Format

Create `~/clawd/.staging/<filename>.review.md` with:

```markdown
# Staging Review: <filename>
**Reviewed by:** Supervisor (GLM-4.7)
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC
**Original:** ~/.clawdbot/<filename>
**Proposed:** ~/clawd/.staging/<filename>.proposed

## Summary
<1-2 sentence description of what Liam is trying to accomplish>

## Changes Detected

### Added
- <item 1>
- <item 2>

### Modified  
- <item 1>: <old value> → <new value>

### Removed
- <item 1>

## Security Review
- [ ] No secrets exposed
- [ ] No permission escalation
- [ ] No unexpected scope changes

## Concerns (if any)
<List any issues Simon should be aware of>

## Recommendation
- [ ] APPROVE - Changes look safe and match stated intent
- [ ] REVIEW CAREFULLY - Minor concerns noted above
- [ ] REJECT - Security or scope issues detected

## For Simon
To apply: `~/clawd/scripts/apply-staging.sh <filename>`
To reject: `rm ~/clawd/.staging/<filename>.proposed`
```

### JSON File Review (moltbot.json, jobs.json)

For JSON config files, Supervisor provides structured analysis:

```markdown
## JSON Diff Analysis

### Keys Added
| Path | Value | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `agents[2].tools.allow[15]` | `"browser"` | Adds browser control to agent |

### Keys Modified
| Path | Old | New | Impact |
|------|-----|-----|--------|
| `agents[0].model.primary` | `"gpt-4"` | `"glm-4.7"` | Model change |

### Keys Removed
| Path | Old Value | Risk |
|------|-----------|------|
| `security.rateLimit` | `100` | May increase API costs |
```

### Automatic Review Cron

**Schedule:** Every 30 minutes (checks for pending staged files)
**Action:** If staged files exist without review, generate review document
**Alert:** Notify Simon that staged changes await review

### Manual Review Invocation

```bash
# Supervisor reviews a specific staged file
moltbot agent --agent supervisor --message "Review staged changes for moltbot.json. Read ~/clawd/.staging/moltbot.json.proposed and compare to ~/.clawdbot/moltbot.json. Document all changes and security implications."
```

## Escalation Triggers

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 3+ failed attempts | Stop, review approach, suggest alternative |
| Context >60% | Recommend /clear, summarize key points |
| Security-sensitive operation | Block, require explicit confirmation |
| Hallucination detected | Block delivery, report finding |
| Subagent timeout >5 min | Check for deadlock, consider termination |
| **Staged file pending >2 hours** | Alert Simon, include review summary |
| **Staged file has security concerns** | Flag as REVIEW CAREFULLY or REJECT |
| **Verification violation detected** | Log to trust-ladder-tracking.md |
| **Protected file directly edited** | CRITICAL alert to Simon |
| **Stale staging file found** | Remind Simon to review/apply |
| **Trust Ladder demotion triggered** | Alert Simon with evidence |

## Verification Compliance Audit (NEW)

The Supervisor tracks Liam's compliance with Pre-Flight Verification rules from SOUL.md.

### What to Check in Session History

For each session, look for these patterns:

| Claim Type | Required Evidence | Violation Pattern |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| File permissions | `ls -la` output before claim | "mode 600" without ls command |
| Service status | `pgrep` or `systemctl` output | "Gateway running" without check |
| Queue state | `read` tool on EVOLUTION-QUEUE.md | "Queue empty" without reading |
| Config values | `cat` or `read` tool output | Citing config without reading |

### Violation Scoring

| Severity | Description | Points |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| CRITICAL | Security claim without verification | -10 |
| HIGH | Status report without live check | -5 |
| MEDIUM | Queue citation without archive check | -3 |
| LOW | Minor assumption without harm | -1 |

### Compliance Report Format

```markdown
## Verification Compliance Report
**Period:** [start] to [end]
**Sessions Reviewed:** N

### Violations Found
| Session | Timestamp | Type | Severity | Details |
|---------|-----------|------|----------|---------|
| abc123 | 2026-01-29 14:00 | Permission claim | CRITICAL | Claimed 644 without ls |

### Compliance Score
- Total sessions: N
- Violations: X
- Score: (N-X)/N * 100 = Y%

### Trust Ladder Status
- Current Level: 1 (Supervised)
- Violations this period: X
- Advancement eligible: [YES/NO]
```

## Trust Ladder Enforcement (NEW)

Supervisor tracks Trust Ladder compliance and recommends level changes.

### Level Criteria

| Level | Requirement | Supervisor Check |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 → 2 | 2 weeks, 100% verification compliance | Review 14 days of sessions |
| 2 → 3 | 1 month at Level 2, continued compliance | Review 30 days of sessions |
| Any → 1 | Any demotion trigger | Flag immediately |

### Demotion Triggers (Auto-Detect)

| Trigger | Detection Method |
|---------|------------------|
| Stale data report | Claim without recent command output |
| Queue citation without check | EVOLUTION-QUEUE.md claim without read |
| Security claim without evidence | Permission/status claim without ls/pgrep |
| Protected file direct edit | Write to protected path without staging |

### Weekly Trust Ladder Report

```markdown
## Trust Ladder Weekly Report
**Week of:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Current Level:** 1 (Supervised)

### Compliance Summary
- Sessions reviewed: N
- Verification violations: X
- Staging workflow usage: Y times
- Protected file violations: Z

### Recommendation
- [ ] MAINTAIN Level 1 (violations detected)
- [ ] ADVANCE to Level 2 (2 weeks clean)
- [ ] DEMOTE to Level 1 (trigger detected)

### Evidence
[List specific sessions/incidents]
```

## Bug Comorbidity Patterns

When supervisor finds an issue, check for related problems:

| If Found | Also Check |
|----------|------------|
| Subagent output wrong | Context overflow, task scoping, model mismatch |
| Hallucinated file path | Other file references, command outputs, link validity |
| Quality degradation | Context rot, token exhaustion, memory poisoning |
| Overnight build failure | PRD ambiguity, test coverage gaps, dependency drift |
| **Verification violation** | Other status claims in same session, pattern across sessions |
| **Staging bypass attempt** | Other protected file access, permission escalation |

## Context Rot Prevention

**Every supervisor evaluation MUST:**
1. Read files fresh - No cached content older than 30 seconds
2. Verify paths exist - Check before referencing any path
3. Timestamp tool outputs - Include execution timestamp
4. Isolate sessions - Start clean each invocation
5. Limit context - Hard cap at 32K tokens

## Model Selection Rationale

| Model | Role | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| MiniMax M2.1 | Primary Worker (Telegram) | ACTIVE |
| Kimi K2.5 | Primary Worker (Discord) | ACTIVE |
| GLM-4.7 | Supervisor / Periodic Audit | ACTIVE (cron) |
| GLM-4.7-flash | Pre-flight (Tier 1) | PLANNED |
| GLM-4.7 | Quality Gate (Tier 2) | PLANNED |
| GLM-4.7 | Subagents | ACTIVE |

## Dual-Channel Supervision Architecture

**Current Implementation:** Periodic audit (Tier 3) only. Pre-delivery supervision (Tier 1/2) awaiting upstream moltbot hooks.

**Key Insight:** Same model reviewing itself has identical blind spots. Both channels use different primary models, but BOTH are reviewed by GLM-4.7 via periodic audit.

```
TELEGRAM:
[User Message] → MiniMax M2.1 (primary) → [Draft]
                                              ↓
                              GLM-4.7 (supervisor) → [Validated]
                                              ↓
                                         [Deliver]

DISCORD:
[User Message] → Kimi K2.5 (primary) → [Draft]
                                            ↓
                            GLM-4.7 (supervisor) → [Validated]
                                            ↓
                                       [Deliver]
```

**Why this works:**
- MiniMax excels at task completion (best finish-rate on Telegram)
- Kimi excels at extended reasoning (long-form on Discord)
- GLM reviews BOTH - catches blind spots from either model
- Different training data = different blind spots = better coverage

**Supervisor Cron covers BOTH channels:**
- Audits `liam-telegram` sessions (MiniMax M2.1 outputs)
- Audits `liam-discord` sessions (Kimi K2.5 outputs)
- Cross-validates: looks for errors one model caught that the other missed

## Usage

The supervisor currently runs via cron job (every 4 hours). Pre-delivery validation awaits upstream moltbot hooks.

```
# Periodic audit (automatic via cron)
Supervisor reviews last 10 sessions from both channels

# Manual invocation
moltbot cron run supervisor-periodic-audit
```

## Comprehensive Audit Checklist

**Used during Periodic Audit (Tier 3):**

### 1. Session Quality
- [ ] Review last 10 sessions from liam-telegram
- [ ] Review last 10 sessions from liam-discord
- [ ] Check for hallucinated file paths
- [ ] Check for repeated errors
- [ ] Check for context overflow warnings

### 2. Verification Compliance (NEW)
- [ ] Scan for status claims without command evidence
- [ ] Scan for permission claims without `ls -la`
- [ ] Scan for queue citations without file read
- [ ] Scan for service status without `pgrep`/`systemctl`
- [ ] Calculate compliance score

### 3. Trust Ladder Status (NEW)
- [ ] Count violations in audit period
- [ ] Check for demotion triggers
- [ ] Determine if advancement eligible
- [ ] Update Trust Ladder recommendation

### 4. Staging Workflow (NEW)
- [ ] Check for pending staged files in `~/clawd/.staging/`
- [ ] Run `~/clawd/scripts/review-staging.sh` if files exist
- [ ] Read generated review documents
- [ ] Flag files pending >2 hours

### 5. Cross-Channel Validation
- [ ] Compare Telegram vs Discord error patterns
- [ ] Look for blind spots one model caught, other missed
- [ ] Check for consistent identity across channels

### 6. System Health
- [ ] Check Evolution Queue for stale entries
- [ ] Verify cron jobs running successfully
- [ ] Check gateway status
- [ ] Review recent diagnostic reports

## Helper Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `~/clawd/scripts/review-staging.sh` | Generate structured diff for staged files | `./review-staging.sh [filename]` |
| `~/clawd/scripts/apply-staging.sh` | Apply staged changes after review | `./apply-staging.sh <filename>` |
| `~/clawd/scripts/queue-cleanup.sh` | Clean up resolved queue entries | `./queue-cleanup.sh` |
| `~/clawd/scripts/self-audit.sh` | Run Liam self-audit | `./self-audit.sh` |

## Upstream Feature Request

To enable Tier 1/2 supervision, moltbot needs:
- Hook event: `response:before-send` or `message:before-deliver`
- Ability to intercept and optionally block message delivery
- Context passing from agent response to supervisor hook
