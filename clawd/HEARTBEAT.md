# Heartbeat Checklist

> If uncertain about capabilities, read `~/clawd/STATUS.md` first - it's the source of truth.

## CRITICAL: Verify Before Reporting

**NEVER report issues from memory files without verification.**

Memory files (everything in `memory/`) are HISTORICAL LOGS, not current state. They record what happened at a specific time, not what is true now. This includes `session-log.md`, dated files, and any other files in that folder.

Before reporting any issue you read in memory:

1. **Run the actual check** - Don't just quote what a memory file says
2. **Verify current state** - Use the actual command/tool to check NOW
3. **If fixed, note it** - Add `[RESOLVED]` marker to the memory entry

**Examples:**
- ❌ BAD: "Memory says gog is not found" → reports old issue as current
- ✅ GOOD: Run `which gog` first → if found, gog is working now

### Verification Commands (ALWAYS run before reporting)

| Status Type | Verification Command |
|-------------|---------------------|
| GOG/Email | `which gog && gog auth list --check` |
| Gateway | `systemctl --user status clawdbot-gateway` |
| Models | `npx clawdbot models list` |
| Ollama | `curl -s http://172.26.0.1:11434/api/tags \| head -5` |

**NEVER report status from:**
- Memory files (memory/*.md) - these are historical logs
- Cached session context - may be stale
- Previous heartbeat responses - `lastHeartbeatText` is STALE
- "I remember that X was broken" - always verify first

### Heartbeat State Freshness

Before using timestamps from `memory/*-heartbeat-state.json`:
1. Read the file fresh (don't use cached version)
2. Check if timestamp is reasonable (not in future, not ancient)
3. If file is missing or corrupt, treat all checks as "never done"

**Stale timestamp symptoms:**
- Duplicate alerts (timestamp not updated after check)
- Missed checks (timestamp artificially in future)

**Memory Entry Format for Issues:**
```markdown
## HH:MM - Issue Description

**Status:** [ACTIVE|RESOLVED|INVESTIGATING]
**Verified:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

[Description]

### Resolution (if resolved)
[How/when it was fixed]
```

---

## Email (clawdbot@puenteworks.com ONLY)

**VERIFY FIRST:** You are checking clawdbot@puenteworks.com, NOT simon@puenteworks.com

- Check inbox: `gog gmail messages search "in:inbox is:unread" --account clawdbot@puenteworks.com --max 10`
- If urgent/important emails found, summarize and alert Simon via Slack
- Reply to acknowledge receipt and explain your plan
- Mark as read after processing

**NEVER check simon@puenteworks.com** - that is Simon's personal email, not yours.

## Calendar (clawdbot@puenteworks.com)

- Check events: `gog calendar events primary --from today --to "+2d" --account clawdbot@puenteworks.com`
- **24h Alert**: If a meeting is in 24-28 hours, ping Simon with: "Meeting in 24h: [Title]. Anything I should prep?"
- **2h Reminder**: If a meeting is in <2 hours, send: "Meeting starting soon: [Title]. Context: [Recent related notes from memory search]"
- **Post-Meeting**: If a meeting just ended (<15m ago), ask: "How did [Title] go? Any action items for me to capture?"
- **Conflict Detect**: Alert if any overlapping events found.

## Context Cue System (ADHD Support)

- Answer: "What should Simon be focusing on right now?"
- Check: Current time, energy level (if known), active projects in `para.sqlite`, and calendar context.
- Suggest: One single high-priority "Next Action" to combat decision paralysis.
- **Visual Timer**: Propose a timer (e.g. "Want me to set a 25m focus timer for this?")

### Context Cue Freshness

When generating context cues:
1. Query para.sqlite directly (not from memory)
2. Check calendar with fresh gog command
3. Never say "I remember you were working on X" - always verify current state

## EF Coaching Check

When Simon is active:
- Note if tasks mentioned but not started (offer support)
- Track any wins since last heartbeat
- Update streak if applicable

One-liner options:
- "Still working on [X]? I'm here."
- "Nice progress today — [count] things done."
- "Day [N] streak. Solid."

## Proactive Monitoring

- If blogwatcher has new items, summarize and alert Simon
- Check weather if Simon has outdoor events today
- Review any active progress files in `~/clawd/progress/`

## Opportunity Monitoring (Opportunity Lifecycle Framework)

- List active opportunities: `~/clawdbot/skills/opportunity-lifecycle/list.sh`
- Check for actions due today or overdue (query: `sqlite3 ~/clawdbot/skills/opportunity-lifecycle/opportunities.sqlite "SELECT * FROM actions WHERE status != 'completed' AND (due_date <= date('now') OR due_date IS NULL) ORDER BY due_date;"`)
- Alert Simon to urgent opportunities (deadline < 24h or stage changed recently)
- For opportunities in "research" stage: surface any new findings
- For opportunities in "monitor" stage: check for status updates
- For opportunities in "document" stage: remind to capture learnings

**When to alert:**
- Action due today or overdue → "Urgent action for [Opportunity]: [Action description] (Due: [Date])"
- Stage changed in last 24h → "[Opportunity] moved to [stage] stage"
- Deadline in <24h → "[Opportunity] action due soon: [Action]"
- Multiple pending actions → Batch alert with opportunity summary

## Evolution Queue Verification (2-3x daily during early dev)

**Verify pending entries are still actually blocked.**

During early development (first 2 weeks), verify EVOLUTION-QUEUE pending entries:
- Morning (9 AM), Afternoon (2 PM), Evening (7 PM)

**How to verify:**
1. Read `~/clawd/EVOLUTION-QUEUE.md`
2. For each entry in "## Pending" section without [RESOLVED]:
   - Run the verification command to check if still broken
   - If fixed: Mark as [RESOLVED] and add resolution note
   - If still broken: Leave as-is
3. Report any stale entries found to Simon

**Quick scan command:**
```bash
grep -n "^### \[" ~/clawd/EVOLUTION-QUEUE.md | grep -v RESOLVED
```

**Why this matters:** Issues get fixed but the queue doesn't always get updated. Stale "pending" entries cause you to report false blockers.

## Data Tracking

- Weekly: Run `clawdbot memory status` to check index health
- Update METRICS.md if significant activity occurred

## Multi-Step Tasks

- Check `~/clawd/progress/` for any in-progress tasks
- If found, read the progress file and continue work
- Update progress file after each step

## General

- If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK
- Do NOT repeat old tasks from prior chats
- Do NOT message Simon just to say hello
