## TASK 5: VIP List (5 min)

**Where:** Just tell Liam via Telegram

### Who should ALWAYS get through to your inbox?

Think about:
- **Family:** (mom, dad, siblings, etc.)
- **Close friends:** (names or emails)
- **Work/clients:** (current important contacts)
- **Healthcare:** (doctor, dentist, therapist)
- **Financial:** (banks - alerts only, not marketing)

**How to tell me:**
Just message: "VIP list: [list names or emails]"

Example: "VIP list: mom, dad, John Smith, my therapist, Chase bank alerts"

I'll figure out the email addresses from context when I see them.

**Done?** Tell Liam: "VIP list sent"

## OPTIONAL: Quick Preferences

Tell me any of these (or skip for now):

1. **Wake time:** What time do you usually wake up?
2. **Sleep time:** What time do you want to be in bed?
3. **Peak focus:** When are you sharpest? (morning/afternoon/evening)
