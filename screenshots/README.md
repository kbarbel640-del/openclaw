# Screenshots Directory

This directory stores all screenshots captured during development, testing, and documentation.

## Directory Structure

```
screenshots/
├── ui-tests/          # Automated UI/browser test screenshots (Vitest/Playwright)
├── e2e-tests/         # End-to-end test screenshots
├── docs/              # Screenshots for documentation purposes
├── manual/            # Manually captured screenshots for debugging/reference
└── README.md          # This file
```

## Usage Guidelines

### UI Test Screenshots

- Automatically generated by browser tests
- Stored in `ui-tests/` with test-specific subdirectories
- Used for visual regression testing and debugging

### E2E Test Screenshots

- Captured during end-to-end test runs
- Stored in `e2e-tests/`
- Help debug test failures across different platforms

### Documentation Screenshots

- Screenshots for docs, README, and marketing materials
- Stored in `docs/`
- Should be high-quality and annotated if needed

### Manual Screenshots

- Ad-hoc screenshots captured during development
- Stored in `manual/`
- Useful for quick debugging and visual reference

## Git Configuration

This directory is listed in `.gitignore` to prevent committing:

- Test screenshots (large, frequently changing)
- Temporary debugging captures
- Personal workspace screenshots

For documentation images that should be committed, use `docs/assets/images/` or `docs/images/` instead.

## Capturing Screenshots

### Chrome DevTools (MCP)

When using the Chrome DevTools MCP integration, screenshots can be saved here:

```
mcp__chrome-devtools__take_screenshot({
  filePath: "screenshots/manual/my-screenshot.png"
})
```

### Vitest Browser Tests

Configure Vitest to save screenshots to this directory by updating test configs to use the `screenshots/` folder.

### Manual Capture

Use your system's screenshot tools and save to the appropriate subdirectory:

- macOS: Cmd+Shift+4 (selection) or Cmd+Shift+5 (full UI)
- Linux: Depends on desktop environment
- Windows: Win+Shift+S (Snipping Tool)

## Cleanup

Periodically clean up old or unnecessary screenshots to keep this directory manageable:

```bash
# Remove all test screenshots
rm -rf screenshots/ui-tests/
rm -rf screenshots/e2e-tests/

# Or clean manually by reviewing contents
```
