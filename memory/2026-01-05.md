## Family
- Kate flies back to Regent Thursday night (Jan 9) out of PVD
- Full family dinner tonight - crockpot parmesan garlic chicken pasta
- Reminder set for 2pm to start crockpot

## Tech
- Installed bird (Twitter) skill from ClawdHub - CLI binary failed to download (GitHub CDN issue)
- WhatsApp gateway was down overnight, missed 6:05am verse delivery
- Sent Romans 12:2 manually at ~6:21am

## Lessons
- Write things down immediately! Missed recording Kate's return date yesterday.

## Cron API Schema (figured out)
**sessionTarget**: `"main"` or `"isolated"`
**wakeMode**: `"next-heartbeat"` or `"now"`
**payload.kind**: 
- `"systemEvent"` (with `text`) — required for main session
- `"agentTurn"` (with `message`, optional `deliver`, `channel`, `to`) — for isolated session

**schedule.kind**:
- `"at"` with `atMs` (Unix ms timestamp)
- `"every"` with `everyMs`
- `"cron"` with `expr` and optional `tz`

Note: main session jobs require systemEvent payload. Use isolated + agentTurn if you need to deliver to a specific channel.
