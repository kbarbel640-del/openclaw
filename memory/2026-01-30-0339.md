## Conversation Summary

assistant: Based on the files in your `Projects` directory (specifically `SECURITY_DEPLOYMENT_ASSESSMENT.md` and the `tabitha/` folder), here is the summary of what was documented/learned:

### 1. Security Setup Assessment
This focused on two voice apps ("Peter" and "vonfranz"), identifying critical vulnerabilities that prevent safe deployment.

*   **Peter (Hume EVI Voice Interface):**
    *   **🔴 CRITICAL:** Live Hume API keys were exposed in the `.env` file and potentially committed to git history. They need immediate rotation and history cleanup (using BFG or `git filter-branch`).
    *   **Needs:** Security headers, CORS configuration, and rate limiting.

*   **vonfranz (Dr. Marie-Louise von Franz AI):**
    *   **🔴 CRITICAL:** The Google Gemini API key is being used client-side (hardcoded or in frontend env vars). This is a blocker for public deployment.
    *   **Required Fix:** You must implement a **backend proxy server** (e.g., Express/Fastify) to handle API calls so the key remains server-side.

*   **General Learnings:**
    *   Both projects lack proper production deployment configurations (Dockerfiles, `vercel.json`).
    *   Recommended architecture: **React App → Backend Proxy → AI Provider**, rather than calling AI APIs directly from the browser.

### 2. Tabitha Project Status
The Tabitha project is marked as **COMPLETE**.

*   **Achievements:**
    *   **✅ Desktop App:** A fully functional Electron application with a "dark esoteric" theme (Gold on Deep Space Blue), native window support, and real-time chat.
    *   **✅ Voice Client:** Enhanced Hume EVI integration for natural speech-to-speech conversation (`./start_voice.sh`).
*   **Architecture:** A FastAPI backend (running Claude Sonnet 4) now serves two robust frontends: the Electron desktop app and the Hume voice client.
*   **Status:** The system is operational, tested, and ready for local use. The backend is ready for Cloud Run deployment.

Would you like me to create a "To-Do" list based on the security assessment (like setting up that proxy for vonfranz)?
