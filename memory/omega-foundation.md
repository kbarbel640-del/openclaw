## Concept

AI-powered Montessori education designed specifically for homeschool families. Inspired by Alpha School's "2 Hour Learning" model but focused on supporting the homeschool network rather than replacing traditional school.

## Current State

Splash page live on Vercel with:
- Positioning: "AI-Powered Montessori Education for Homeschool Families"
- Programs: Early Childhood (3-6), Elementary (6-12), Adolescent (12-18)
- Key features: AI personalization, Montessori method, homeschool support, global community
- Aspirational metrics on page (500+ families, 98% satisfaction)

## Alpha School (Model to Study)

- **Location:** Austin, Texas (physical school)
- **Model:** "2 Hour Learning" — core academics in 2 hrs/day via AI tutors
- **Afternoons:** Life skills, passion projects
- **No traditional teachers** — AI-powered adaptive learning
- **Pricing:** Private school rates (~$15-25K/year estimated)
- **Website:** alpha.school

### Alpha School Key Differentiators
- Adaptive AI technology for 1:1 personalized learning
- Gamification elements
- Growth mindset focus
- Physical campus with "adults in the room" as guides

## Omega's Opportunity
