## Technical findings
- **Bedrock Llama 3.2 (1B/3B) Investigation**: Successfully configured and authorized these models in Clawdbot.
- **Streaming Tool Limitation**: Confirmed that Bedrock Llama 3.2 models currently trigger an error ("This model doesn't support tool use in streaming mode") when tools are present in a streaming session. This prevents them from being used as sub-agents where tools are automatically injected.
- **Status**: Available for pure text generation but not for tool-augmented tasks or sub-agent runs.
