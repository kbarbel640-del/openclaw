# 2026-01-31 — Agent Console + UndercoverAgent.ai Launch

## Agent Console Refinements

- **UX Architect agent created** (`/agents/ux-architect/AGENT.md`) for design system cohesion
- UX audit completed: stripped Dashboard to stats + live activity feed only
- Each tab now has ONE clear purpose:
  - Dashboard: "What's happening now?" (stats + activity feed)
  - Agents: "Who can I deploy?" (roster + spawn)
  - Sessions: "What are they doing?" (conversations)
  - Tasks: "What needs to be done?" (Vikunja backlog)
- Added multi-project support: now tracks MeshGuard, SaveState, Agent Console, Inbox
- Fixed bottom nav spacing, label truncation, added Tasks to nav
- Live: https://dashboard.agentconsole.app

## New Idea Exploration

### Agent Optimized (NO-GO)
- Website grader for AI/LLM readiness (like HubSpot SEO grader)
- Scout research: 15+ competitors already, including HubSpot's free AEO Grader
- llms.txt adoption only 0.2%
- **Decision: NO-GO**

### AgentTest / AgentvAgent (Conditional)
- Pivot: AI agents that test websites
- Market crowded (Momentic $15M, Skyvern, etc.)
- **Niche opportunity: Agent-vs-Agent testing** (test AI chatbots WITH AI agents)

### UndercoverAgent.ai (GO) 🕵️
- **Final pivot**: Secret shopper for AI agents
- Like uTest but for AI - deploy agents to test company chatbots
- David loved this direction

**Vikunja Project:** ID 9

## David's Design Feedback (Important!)

> "I'm very disappointed with the quality of the design. This is the most boring template. Canvas has nano-banana-pro and incredible capabilities. Our startups should have bespoke design unlike any other. Instantly recognizable. Innovative, interactive, stunning graphics, unexpected surprise and delight."

**Lesson:** Never ship generic templates. Always bespoke, always stunning.

## Pending

- **Merge conflicts** from upstream sync need resolution:
  - AGENTS.md
  - pnpm-lock.yaml
  - src/infra/unhandled-rejections.ts

## Agent Roster Update

Added **🏗️ UX Architect** to roster:
- Role: Design system consistency, information architecture, UX cohesion
