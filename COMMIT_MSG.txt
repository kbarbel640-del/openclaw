feat(gateway): implement strictLoopback enforcement for Control UI

Implements full enforcement logic for the strictLoopback config field:

- Add isClientAllowedByLoopbackPolicy() helper to check IP restrictions
- Reject non-loopback requests with 403 Forbidden when strictLoopback=true
- Support IPv4 (127.0.0.1) and IPv6 (::1) loopback addresses
- Respect x-forwarded-for headers when trusted proxies configured
- Apply enforcement to both avatar and HTTP request handlers
- Add comprehensive test coverage (5 test cases)
- Pass trustedProxies config to handlers for accurate IP resolution
- Update PR_BODY.md with correct description

This addresses Greptile's review on PR #6590 that noted the config
field had no actual implementation. Fixes #6590.
