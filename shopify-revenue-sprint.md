**Pitch Script:**
> "Hi [Name], I noticed your Shopify store [Store] and wanted to share something that could save you serious money. I've built an AI bot that predicts when you'll run out of stock BEFORE it happens - most stores lose 20-30% revenue from stockouts they never see coming. 
>
> I'm offering 3 beta spots at $49/month (normally $199) for stores willing to test it. Would you be interested in a 15-minute demo to see how much revenue you might be losing to inventory gaps?"
