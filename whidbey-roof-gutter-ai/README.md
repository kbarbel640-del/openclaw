## 🌟 **Conversation Flow Examples**

### **📞 Standard Gutter Cleaning Inquiry**
```
AI: "Hi there! Thanks for calling Whidbey Island Roof and Gutter Cleaning. 
     This is your AI assistant. Are you calling about gutter cleaning, 
     pressure washing, or maybe some storm damage?"

Customer: "My gutters are overflowing when it rains."

AI: "Oh no! Clogged gutters during our wet season can definitely cause problems. 
     Let me help you get this sorted out. Can you tell me - is this a single 
     story or two-story home?"

Customer: "Two story house in Coupeville."

AI: "Perfect! I know that area well - lots of beautiful older homes there. 
     For a two-story gutter cleaning in Coupeville, we typically charge 
     around $180-220 depending on the roof complexity. 
     
     Would you like me to schedule a time for our team to come take a look? 
     I can work around the ferry schedule if you commute off-island."
```

### **📱 Photo Estimate Request**
```
AI: "For the most accurate estimate, I'd love to see some photos of your 
     gutters and roofline. You can text them to this same number, or I can 
     send you a link to upload them securely. 
     
     Just snap a few pictures of the problem areas and the overall roofline, 
     and I can usually give you a firm quote within 10 minutes!"

Customer: "I'll send some photos now."

AI: "Fantastic! I'll analyze them right away. While you're taking photos, 
     also grab a shot of how high your gutters are - that helps me factor 
     in the ladder work and safety requirements. 
     
     I'll call you back in just a few minutes with your personalized quote!"
```

### **🌧️ Weather Emergency**
```
AI: "Thanks for calling Whidbey Island Roof and Gutter! I see we've got 
     quite a storm hitting the island today. Are you experiencing some 
     urgent damage that needs immediate attention?"

Customer: "Yes, my gutter is hanging off the house!"

AI: "That definitely needs immediate attention for safety! Let me get you 
     on our emergency response list. Can you tell me your address and 
     describe what happened?"

Customer: "Tree branch fell and pulled the gutter loose at 123 Oak Street."

AI: "I've got you down for emergency service at 123 Oak Street. Our crew 
     can be there within 2 hours to secure that gutter safely. The emergency 
     service fee is $175 for the call-out, plus materials and additional 
     repair time.
     
     I'm also checking... yes, the storm should clear by this afternoon, 
     so perfect timing for permanent repairs. Can I get your contact info?"
