# Super 8 — Wedding Pastel

## Film Stock Identity

This is the Department of Vibe Super 8 Wedding Pastel stock. It recreates the
look of Super 8mm motion film as used in wedding videography — soft pastels,
lifted shadows, gentle warmth, and organic grain.

## Target Characteristics

- **Color Temperature**: Warm bias (+200-400K from neutral)
- **Shadows**: Lifted, never crushed. Shadows should feel airy and open.
- **Highlights**: Soft rolloff. No harsh clipping.
- **Saturation**: Reduced overall (-15 to -25), with selective warmth in skin tones
- **Grain**: Fine, organic. Amount 20-35, Size 25-40, Roughness 40-60
- **Tone Curve**: Gentle S-curve with lifted blacks and rolled highlights
- **Green/Teal**: Slightly muted. Foliage should feel dreamy, not vivid.
- **Skin Tones**: Preserved and slightly warmed. Never orange, never flat.

## What This Stock Does NOT Do

- Does not crush blacks or create high contrast
- Does not oversaturate any channel
- Does not create a cold or clinical look
- Does not alter facial geometry or skin texture
- Does not apply heavy vignetting (subtle at most)

## Adjustment Priorities

When developing an image with this stock:

1. Set base exposure — aim for slightly bright, airy feel
2. Warm the white balance gently (temp +200-400)
3. Lift shadows significantly (+30 to +50)
4. Pull highlights down slightly (-20 to -40)
5. Reduce overall saturation (-15 to -25)
6. Warm orange/yellow HSL hues slightly
7. Mute greens and teals in HSL saturation
8. Apply fine grain (amount 25, size 30, roughness 50)

## Reference Behavior

The photographer should feel like they're looking at a frame from a Super 8
wedding film — nostalgic, warm, soft, and timeless. The edit should feel
effortless, as if the camera naturally captured this way.
