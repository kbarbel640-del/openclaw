# Skill: Workflow Management

Coordinate sprints, releases, and multi-agent collaboration.

## Execution Flow

```
TASK RECEIVED
      ↓
CHECK INBOX (sessions_inbox — pick up messages and context)
      ↓
CHECK TEAM CONTEXT (team_workspace get_summary — read shared state)
      ↓
UNDERSTAND (read existing code, 70% of time)
      ↓
PLAN (create task breakdown)
      ↓
DEBATE IF NEEDED (collaboration session.init — for complex decisions)
      ↓
DELEGATE (spawn appropriate agents)
      ↓
EXECUTE (parallel implementation)
      ↓
SHARE RESULTS (team_workspace write_artifact — publish outputs)
      ↓
VALIDATE (lint + typecheck + test + build)
      ↓
DELIVER (commit or report)
```

## Complexity Scale

| Complexity | Criteria                 | Approach                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Simple     | 1-2 files, bug fix       | Execute directly                       |
| Medium     | 3-5 files, small feature | 3 agents, parallel                     |
| Complex    | 6+ files, full feature   | Plan → approve → phased implementation |

## Workflow by Type

### New Feature

```
Read context → Plan → [Database →] Backend → Frontend → Tests → Validate → Commit
```

### Bug Fix

```
Reproduce → Diagnose ROOT cause → Minimal fix → Regression test → Validate → Commit
```

### Refactoring

```
Ensure tests exist → Refactor incrementally → Tests after each change → Commit
```

## Sprint Planning

```markdown
## Sprint [N]: [Theme]

### Goals

1. [Goal 1]
2. [Goal 2]

### Tasks

| ID  | Task   | Owner   | Status         | Priority |
| --- | ------ | ------- | -------------- | -------- |
| T1  | [Task] | [Agent] | 🔵 Todo        | P1       |
| T2  | [Task] | [Agent] | 🟡 In Progress | P1       |
| T3  | [Task] | [Agent] | 🟢 Done        | P2       |

### Dependencies

- T2 blocks T3
- T1 requires external API

### Risks

- [Risk 1]: Mitigation
```

## Release Workflow

```markdown
## Release v[X.Y.Z]

### Pre-Release Checklist

- [ ] All features complete
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Security review done
- [ ] Performance validated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Changelog updated

### Release Steps

1. Create release branch
2. Final validation
3. Update version numbers
4. Create tag
5. Deploy to staging
6. Smoke tests
7. Deploy to production
8. Monitor for issues

### Rollback Plan

- Revert to v[previous]
- Notify stakeholders
- Document incident
```

## Multi-Agent Coordination

### Parallel Work Pattern

```typescript
// Independent tasks - spawn in parallel
sessions_spawn({ task: "Database schema", agentId: "database-engineer", label: "DB" });
sessions_spawn({ task: "API design", agentId: "backend-architect", label: "API" });
sessions_spawn({ task: "UI wireframes", agentId: "ux-designer", label: "UX" });
```

### Sequential Work Pattern

```typescript
// Dependent tasks - wait for each
const dbResult = await sessions_spawn({ task: "Create tables", agentId: "database-engineer" });
const apiResult = await sessions_spawn({
  task: "Build API using the schema",
  agentId: "backend-architect",
});
const uiResult = await sessions_spawn({
  task: "Build UI using the API",
  agentId: "frontend-architect",
});
```

### Review Chain

```typescript
// Implementation → Quality → Security → Approval
sessions_spawn({ task: "Implement feature", agentId: "backend-architect" });
// After completion:
sessions_spawn({ task: "Quality review", agentId: "quality-engineer" });
sessions_spawn({ task: "Security review", agentId: "security-engineer" });
```

## Decision-Driven Workflow

For complex decisions that affect multiple agents, use the debate-then-delegate pattern:

```typescript
// 1. Debate the approach
collaboration({
  action: "session.init",
  topic: "Architecture for the new billing module",
  agents: ["backend-architect", "database-engineer", "system-architect"],
});

// 2. After decision is finalized, share as artifact
team_workspace({
  action: "write_artifact",
  name: "billing-architecture.md",
  content: "# Billing Module Architecture\n...",
  description: "Agreed architecture from debate session",
  tags: ["architecture", "billing"],
});

// 3. Delegate implementation based on the decision
sessions_spawn({
  task: "Implement billing API per billing-architecture.md artifact",
  agentId: "backend-architect",
  label: "Billing API",
});
```

## Delegation

```typescript
// Sprint planning
sessions_spawn({
  task: "Break down the user authentication epic into sprint tasks. Estimate complexity and assign to appropriate agents.",
  agentId: "scrum-master",
  model: "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
  label: "Sprint Planning",
});

// Release coordination
sessions_spawn({
  task: "Prepare release v2.0.0. Update changelog, version numbers, create release notes.",
  agentId: "release-manager",
  model: "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
  label: "Release Prep",
});

// Technical coordination
sessions_spawn({
  task: "Coordinate the backend refactoring. Ensure tests pass after each change, no breaking changes.",
  agentId: "tech-lead",
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
  label: "Backend Refactor Coordination",
});
```
