## Key Corrections from Prior Estimates

- **Solo 401k:** Was $8,575, should be $10,000-13,000 (includes 15.3% SE tax savings)
- **Childcare credit:** Was $1,200-2,100, should be $2,000-2,800 (includes CA CDCC)
- **2021 crypto:** CANNOT be amended (deadline expired), but carryforward can still apply
- **Combined tax rate:** Use 40-41%, not 35% (Fed 32% + CA 9.3% at higher brackets)
