# TikTok Shop Affiliate Compliance Rules

**Priority: ACCOUNT SAFETY ABOVE ALL ELSE**

Eli's directive: "Always go with the safer version. I don't want to risk any problems of account being banned."

## Hard Rules (auto-enforced, no exceptions)

1. **No medical claims** — Never say "cures", "treats", "heals", "doctor-approved", "clinically proven", "medical-grade" unless the product listing explicitly states FDA approval
2. **No false guarantees** — Never say "guaranteed results", "works 100%", "never fails"
3. **No exaggerated claims** — If showing before/after, must include "results may vary"
4. **No redirecting off TikTok Shop** — Never say "link in bio", never mention external URLs, Amazon, personal websites
5. **No targeting minors** — No content marketed toward children, no kids in promotional content
6. **No misleading beauty filters** — Don't suggest using filters that exaggerate product results
7. **No gambling/auctions/gamification** — No "spin to win", giveaway mechanics
8. **No shocking/disturbing clickbait** — No gore, violence, extreme imagery as hooks
9. **Product must be verbally mentioned or visually shown** — Text overlay alone doesn't count (rule since Oct 2025)
10. **Original content only** — No re-used/pre-recorded content passed off as new

## Soft Rules (auto-applied, flagged if borderline)

- Before/after comparisons → auto-add "results may vary" disclaimer
- Health/wellness products → extra conservative language, no condition-specific claims
- Urgency → must be plausible (price changes, selling fast) not fabricated ("only 3 left!" unless verified)
- Competitor mentions → avoid naming competitors directly
- Weight loss products → HIGH RISK category, avoid "risky weight management content"
- Supplements → lower-risk wellness claims only, no "cures" or "replaces medication"

## Banned Phrases

Never use these in scripts:

- "Stop scrolling"
- "Guaranteed to work"
- "Cures [condition]"
- "Doctor recommended" (unless verified)
- "FDA approved" (unless verified)
- "Link in bio"
- "Click the link in my profile"
- "Better than [competitor name]"
- "You NEED this" (when targeting minors)
- "100% results"
- "Miracle product"

## Safe Alternatives

| Instead of                | Use                                             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| "Cures plantar fasciitis" | "People with plantar fasciitis are loving this" |
| "Guaranteed to work"      | "The reviews speak for themselves"              |
| "Doctor recommended"      | "Thousands of five-star reviews"                |
| "Only 3 left"             | "The price on this keeps going up"              |
| "You need this"           | "If you deal with [problem], check this out"    |
| "Best product ever"       | "One of the best I've tried"                    |

## Enforcement Reality

- Same violation 6x in 90 days = e-commerce permissions removed + commissions frozen
- Severe violations = immediate suspension (no warning)
- TikTok has a Video Pre-Check Tool — recommend Eli uses it before posting
- Creator Health Rating (CHR) tracks violations — repeated issues compound
