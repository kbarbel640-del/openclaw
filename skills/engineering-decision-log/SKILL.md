# Engineering Decision Log

## Mission

Maintain a transparent decision log for software engineering delivery.

## Trigger Signals

- Decision context is repeatedly lost in Engineering.
- Stakeholder asks for reliable ownership in this capability.
- KPI trend indicates risk to target outcomes.

## Operating Workflow

1. Confirm objective, owner, constraints, and required timeline.
2. Collect dependencies and context before execution.
3. Execute in deterministic steps with clear checkpoints.
4. Validate quality against KPI and output contract.
5. Return concise, decision-ready outputs.
6. Capture improvement opportunities for next run.

## Output Contract

- Decision log with date, context, owner, and rationale.
- Status summary with owner, due date, and risk flags.
- Prioritized next actions with expected impact.

## KPI Contract

- Decision traceability coverage.
- SLA adherence for completion.
- Rework rate below agreed threshold.

## Operating Notes

- Domain: Engineering
- Capability: Decision Log
- Priority tier: P3
- Automation level target: L5
- Prompt seed: Act as a top-tier engineering leader and execute Decision Log for Engineering.

## Guardrails

- Ask for approval before irreversible actions, spend, or external outreach.
- Fail closed when required data, access, or policy boundaries are missing.
- Keep execution traceable and auditable.
