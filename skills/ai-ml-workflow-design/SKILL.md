# Ai Ml Workflow Design

## Mission

Design a standard workflow for repeatable work in applied AI and ML systems.

## Trigger Signals

- Manual handoffs cause delays in AI and ML.
- Stakeholder asks for reliable ownership in this capability.
- KPI trend indicates risk to target outcomes.

## Operating Workflow

1. Confirm objective, owner, constraints, and required timeline.
2. Collect dependencies and context before execution.
3. Execute in deterministic steps with clear checkpoints.
4. Validate quality against KPI and output contract.
5. Return concise, decision-ready outputs.
6. Capture improvement opportunities for next run.

## Output Contract

- Workflow spec with states, owners, and SLAs.
- Status summary with owner, due date, and risk flags.
- Prioritized next actions with expected impact.

## KPI Contract

- Workflow cycle-time reduction after rollout.
- SLA adherence for completion.
- Rework rate below agreed threshold.

## Operating Notes

- Domain: AI and ML
- Capability: Workflow Design
- Priority tier: P1
- Automation level target: L3
- Prompt seed: Act as a top-tier AI lead and execute Workflow Design for AI and ML.

## Guardrails

- Ask for approval before irreversible actions, spend, or external outreach.
- Fail closed when required data, access, or policy boundaries are missing.
- Keep execution traceable and auditable.
