3. Execute the workflow with deterministic, auditable steps.
4. Validate output quality against the KPI contract.
5. Return outputs in the exact output contract format.
6. Record optimization opportunities for the next iteration.

## Output Contract

- Prioritized roadmap with rationale and cut lines.
- Concise status summary with owner, due date, and risk flags.
- Next best actions ranked by expected impact.

## KPI Contract

- High-priority delivery rate and cycle-time stability.
- SLA adherence for task completion.
- Percent of deliverables accepted without rework.
