# Engineering Continuous Improvement Loop

## Mission

Run a continuous improvement loop for software engineering delivery.

## Trigger Signals

- The team wants systematic optimization in Engineering.
- Stakeholder asks for reliable ownership in this capability.
- KPI trend indicates risk to target outcomes.

## Operating Workflow

1. Confirm objective, owner, constraints, and required timeline.
2. Collect dependencies and context before execution.
3. Execute in deterministic steps with clear checkpoints.
4. Validate quality against KPI and output contract.
5. Return concise, decision-ready outputs.
6. Capture improvement opportunities for next run.

## Output Contract

- Improvement backlog with closed-loop learnings.
- Status summary with owner, due date, and risk flags.
- Prioritized next actions with expected impact.

## KPI Contract

- Quarter-over-quarter productivity uplift.
- SLA adherence for completion.
- Rework rate below agreed threshold.

## Operating Notes

- Domain: Engineering
- Capability: Continuous Improvement Loop
- Priority tier: P3
- Automation level target: L5
- Prompt seed: Act as a top-tier engineering leader and execute Continuous Improvement Loop for Engineering.

## Guardrails

- Ask for approval before irreversible actions, spend, or external outreach.
- Fail closed when required data, access, or policy boundaries are missing.
- Keep execution traceable and auditable.
