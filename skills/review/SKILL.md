## Collaboration Review Workflow

Use `collaboration` for structured async code reviews with tracked status.

### Submit Work for Review

```typescript
collaboration({
  action: "submit_review",
  artifact: "src/orders/order-service.ts",
  reviewers: ["security-engineer", "quality-engineer"],
  context: "New order creation flow. Focus on input validation and authorization.",
});
// Returns: { reviewId: "rev-abc123" }
```

### Submit Review Feedback

```typescript
// Approve with feedback
collaboration({
  action: "review.submit",
  reviewId: "rev-abc123",
  approved: true,
  feedback: "Input validation looks solid. Minor: consider adding rate limiting on create.",
});

// Reject with feedback
collaboration({
  action: "review.submit",
  reviewId: "rev-abc123",
  approved: false,
  feedback: "Missing authorization check on the delete endpoint. Must fix before merge.",
});
```

### Check Review Status

```typescript
// Get specific review
collaboration({ action: "review.get", reviewId: "rev-abc123" });

// List all pending reviews
collaboration({ action: "review.list" });

// List completed reviews
collaboration({ action: "review.list", completed: true });
```

### When to Use Collaboration Reviews

| Scenario            | Approach                                                               |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quick spot check    | Direct review (read code, provide feedback)                            |
| Formal code review  | collaboration submit_review with tracked status                        |
| Security audit      | collaboration submit_review with security-engineer reviewer            |
| Architecture review | collaboration session.init for debate, then submit_review for sign-off |

## Delegation

For security-focused review:

```typescript
sessions_spawn({
  task: "Security review of the auth module changes in PR #123. Check for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.",
  agentId: "security-engineer",
  model: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",
  label: "Security Review",
});
```

For quality review:

```typescript
sessions_spawn({
  task: "Code quality review of src/api/ changes. Check for patterns, tests, and maintainability.",
  agentId: "quality-engineer",
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
  label: "Quality Review",
});
```
