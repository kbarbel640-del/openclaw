# Skill: Troubleshooting

Systematic debugging and root cause analysis.

## Investigation Workflow

### 1. Reproduce

```
Can I reproduce the issue?
|
+-- YES --> Document reproduction steps
|
+-- NO --> Gather more context
    |
    +-- Logs, error messages
    +-- Environment details
    +-- Recent changes
```

### 2. Isolate

```
Where does the issue occur?
|
+-- Frontend only --> Browser, component, state
+-- Backend only --> API, service, database
+-- Both --> Integration point, network
+-- Intermittent --> Race condition, timing, resources
```

### 3. Root Cause (5 Whys)

```markdown
**Problem:** API returns 500 error

1. Why? → Server threw unhandled exception
2. Why? → Database query failed
3. Why? → Connection pool exhausted
4. Why? → Connections not being released
5. Why? → Missing finally block in transaction handler

**Root Cause:** Missing cleanup in transaction handler
**Fix:** Add finally block to release connection
```

### 4. Fix and Verify

```
1. Create failing test that reproduces the bug
2. Implement the fix
3. Verify test passes
4. Check for similar issues elsewhere
5. Add regression test
```

## Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check logs
tail -f /tmp/openclaw-gateway.log

# Check process
ps aux | grep openclaw

# Check ports
lsof -i :18789

# Check network
curl -v http://localhost:18789/health

# Check database
psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity"
```

## Common Issues Checklist

- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Connection pool exhausted
- [ ] Timeout too short

### Data Issues

- [ ] Corrupt data

```

## Team Investigation

### Check Team Context First

```typescript
// Read team workspace for prior context on the issue
team_workspace({ action: "get_summary" });

// Check inbox for related messages
sessions_inbox({ scope: "agent" });
```

### Share RCA Findings

```typescript
// Write root cause analysis as artifact
team_workspace({
  action: "write_artifact",
  name: "rca-auth-503.md",
  content:
    "# RCA: Auth Service 503 Errors\n\n## Root Cause\nConnection pool exhaustion...\n## Fix\n...",
  description: "Root cause analysis for intermittent auth 503 errors",
  tags: ["rca", "incident", "auth"],
});
```

### Debate Multi-Solution Scenarios

```typescript
// When multiple fixes are viable, start a debate
collaboration({
  action: "session.init",
  topic: "Fix strategy for connection pool exhaustion",
  agents: ["backend-architect", "database-engineer", "sre"],
});
```

---

## Delegation

```typescript
// Complex debugging
sessions_spawn({
  task: "Investigate why the auth service intermittently returns 503. Check logs, database connections, and recent deployments. Use 5 Whys for root cause.",
  agentId: "root-cause-analyst",
  model: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",
  label: "Auth 503 Investigation",
});

// Performance investigation
sessions_spawn({
  task: "Profile the orders API endpoint. It's responding in 2s+. Identify bottlenecks and recommend optimizations.",
  agentId: "performance-engineer",
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
  label: "Orders API Performance",
});
```
