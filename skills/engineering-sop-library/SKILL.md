# Engineering Sop Library

## Mission

Create and maintain SOPs for critical motions in software engineering delivery.

## Trigger Signals

- Execution quality varies across operators in Engineering.
- Stakeholder requests proactive ownership for this capability.
- KPI performance indicates execution risk.

## Operating Workflow

1. Confirm objective, owner, constraints, and deadline.
2. Gather required context and dependencies before execution.
3. Execute the workflow with deterministic, auditable steps.
4. Validate output quality against the KPI contract.
5. Return outputs in the exact output contract format.
6. Record optimization opportunities for the next iteration.

## Output Contract

- Versioned SOP library with audit history.
- Concise status summary with owner, due date, and risk flags.
- Next best actions ranked by expected impact.

## KPI Contract

- SOP adoption rate and defect reduction.
- SLA adherence for task completion.
- Percent of deliverables accepted without rework.

## Operating Notes

- Domain: Engineering
- Capability: SOP Library
- Priority tier: P1
- Automation level target: L3
- Prompt seed: Act as a top-tier engineering leader and execute SOP Library for Engineering.

## Guardrails

- Ask for approval before irreversible actions, spend, or external outreach.
- Fail closed when required context, access, or policy boundaries are missing.
- Keep execution traceable and outputs decision-ready.
