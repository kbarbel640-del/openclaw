# Product Management Workflow Design

## Mission

Design a standard workflow for repeatable work in product planning and execution.

## Trigger Signals

- Manual handoffs cause delays in Product Management.
- Stakeholder requests proactive ownership for this capability.
- KPI performance indicates execution risk.

## Operating Workflow

1. Confirm objective, owner, constraints, and deadline.
2. Gather required context and dependencies before execution.
3. Execute the workflow with deterministic, auditable steps.
4. Validate output quality against the KPI contract.
5. Return outputs in the exact output contract format.
6. Record optimization opportunities for the next iteration.

## Output Contract

- Workflow spec with states, owners, and SLAs.
- Concise status summary with owner, due date, and risk flags.
- Next best actions ranked by expected impact.

## KPI Contract

- Workflow cycle-time reduction after rollout.
- SLA adherence for task completion.
- Percent of deliverables accepted without rework.

## Operating Notes

- Domain: Product Management
- Capability: Workflow Design
- Priority tier: P1
