# Cinestill 800T — Night/Dusk

## Film Stock Identity

This is the Department of Vibe Cinestill 800T stock. Cinestill 800T is a
tungsten-balanced ISO 800 cinema film (Kodak Vision3 500T with the remjet
layer removed). It produces distinctive halation around bright light sources,
warm amber highlights, and a unique color palette suited to night and dusk
photography.

## Target Characteristics

- **Color Temperature**: Tungsten-balanced. Under daylight, produces warm amber cast.
  Under tungsten, renders more neutral with slight warmth.
- **Highlights**: Warm amber/orange halation around point light sources.
  Highlights should glow, not clip harshly.
- **Shadows**: Deep but not crushed. Retain detail in shadow areas.
- **Saturation**: Moderate. Blues and teals are distinctive. Reds are warm.
- **Grain**: Moderate, visible. Amount 30-45, Size 30-50, Roughness 50-70
- **Tone Curve**: Moderate contrast with lifted shadow floor
- **Blues/Teals**: Signature Cinestill blue-green in shadows and cool areas
- **Skin Tones**: Warm, slightly amber. Natural but with film character.

## What This Stock Does NOT Do

- Does not create a flat or desaturated look
- Does not cool down warm light sources
- Does not crush shadows completely
- Does not alter facial geometry or skin texture
- Does not remove the distinctive warm cast under mixed lighting

## Adjustment Priorities

When developing an image with this stock:

1. Set exposure — night scenes need careful exposure, avoid blowing highlights
2. Set white balance to tungsten-warm (temp 3800-4500 depending on scene)
3. Add slight warmth to highlights via split toning or temp
4. Ensure shadows are deep but retain detail (+10 to +25 shadows)
5. Boost blue/teal saturation slightly for the signature Cinestill look
6. Warm the orange/red HSL hues
7. Apply moderate grain (amount 35, size 40, roughness 60)
8. Add subtle vignette for night atmosphere

## Reference Behavior

The photographer should feel like they're shooting Cinestill 800T at night —
warm glowing lights, distinctive blue shadows, visible grain, and that
unmistakable halation around bright sources.
