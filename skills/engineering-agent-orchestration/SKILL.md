# Engineering Agent Orchestration

## Mission

Orchestrate AI agents for high-volume workflows in software engineering delivery.

## Trigger Signals

- Workload spikes require parallel automation in Engineering.
- Stakeholder requests proactive ownership for this capability.
- KPI performance indicates execution risk.

## Operating Workflow

1. Confirm objective, owner, constraints, and deadline.
2. Gather required context and dependencies before execution.
3. Execute the workflow with deterministic, auditable steps.
4. Validate output quality against the KPI contract.
5. Return outputs in the exact output contract format.
6. Record optimization opportunities for the next iteration.

## Output Contract

- Agent workflow graph with fallback and retry policy.
- Concise status summary with owner, due date, and risk flags.
- Next best actions ranked by expected impact.

## KPI Contract

- Autonomous completion rate without human escalation.
- SLA adherence for task completion.
- Percent of deliverables accepted without rework.

## Operating Notes

- Domain: Engineering
- Capability: Agent Orchestration
- Priority tier: P1
- Automation level target: L3
- Prompt seed: Act as a top-tier engineering leader and execute Agent Orchestration for Engineering.

## Guardrails

- Ask for approval before irreversible actions, spend, or external outreach.
- Fail closed when required context, access, or policy boundaries are missing.
- Keep execution traceable and outputs decision-ready.
