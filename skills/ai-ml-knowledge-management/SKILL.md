# Ai Ml Knowledge Management

## Mission

Build a searchable knowledge layer for applied AI and ML systems.

## Trigger Signals

- Repeated questions create drag in AI and ML.
- Stakeholder asks for reliable ownership in this capability.
- KPI trend indicates risk to target outcomes.

## Operating Workflow

1. Confirm objective, owner, constraints, and required timeline.
2. Collect dependencies and context before execution.
3. Execute in deterministic steps with clear checkpoints.
4. Validate quality against KPI and output contract.
5. Return concise, decision-ready outputs.
6. Capture improvement opportunities for next run.

## Output Contract

- Indexed knowledge base with freshness policy.
- Status summary with owner, due date, and risk flags.
- Prioritized next actions with expected impact.

## KPI Contract

- Knowledge reuse rate and answer latency.
- SLA adherence for completion.
- Rework rate below agreed threshold.

## Operating Notes

- Domain: AI and ML
- Capability: Knowledge Management
- Priority tier: P2
- Automation level target: L4
- Prompt seed: Act as a top-tier AI lead and execute Knowledge Management for AI and ML.

## Guardrails

- Ask for approval before irreversible actions, spend, or external outreach.
- Fail closed when required data, access, or policy boundaries are missing.
- Keep execution traceable and auditable.
