# Skill: Security Audit

Comprehensive security assessment following industry standards.

## OWASP Top 10 Checklist

### A01: Broken Access Control

- [ ] Auth required on all protected routes
- [ ] Role-based access control implemented
- [ ] No direct object references without validation
- [ ] CORS configured restrictively
- [ ] Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

### A02: Cryptographic Failures

- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt/argon2
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- [ ] TLS enforced for data in transit
- [ ] No weak algorithms (MD5, SHA1)
- [ ] Secrets in environment variables

### A03: Injection

- [ ] SQL parameterized queries (no string concat)
- [ ] NoSQL injection prevention
- [ ] Command injection prevention
- [ ] LDAP injection prevention

### A04: Insecure Design

- [ ] Threat model documented
- [ ] Security requirements defined
- [ ] Secure defaults configured
- [ ] Defense in depth

### A05: Security Misconfiguration

- [ ] Error messages don't leak info
- [ ] Debug mode disabled in prod
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Unnecessary features disabled

### A06: Vulnerable Components

- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] No known CVEs
- [ ] Automated dependency scanning
- [ ] Minimal dependencies

### A07: Auth Failures

- [ ] Strong password policy
- [ ] Account lockout implemented
- [ ] Session management secure
- [ ] MFA available

### A08: Data Integrity Failures

- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline secured
- [ ] Code signing where appropriate

### A09: Logging Failures

- [ ] Security events logged
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Log integrity protected
- [ ] Alerting configured

### A10: SSRF

- [ ] URL validation
- [ ] Allowlist for external calls
- [ ] Response validation

## STRIDE Threat Model

| Threat                | Question                  | Mitigation                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **S**poofing          | Can attacker impersonate? | Auth, certificates          |
| **T**ampering         | Can data be modified?     | Integrity checks, signing   |
| **R**epudiation       | Can actions be denied?    | Audit logs                  |
| **I**nfo Disclosure   | Can data leak?            | Encryption, access control  |
| **D**enial of Service | Can service be blocked?   | Rate limiting, redundancy   |
| **E**levation         | Can privileges increase?  | Least privilege, validation |

## Security Review Command

```bash
# Check for hardcoded secrets
grep -rn "password\|secret\|api_key\|token" --include="*.ts" src/

# Check dependencies
npm audit
pnpm audit

# Check for SQL injection patterns
grep -rn "SELECT.*\${" --include="*.ts" src/
grep -rn "INSERT.*\${" --include="*.ts" src/
```

## Team Security Workflow

### Submit Security Audit for Review

```typescript
// Submit audit findings for team review
collaboration({
  action: "submit_review",
  artifact: "Security audit report for src/auth/ module",
  reviewers: ["backend-architect", "tech-lead"],
  context: "Found 2 high-severity issues in token handling. Review remediation plan.",
});
```

### Record Security Decisions

```typescript
// Write security decision as artifact
team_workspace({
  action: "write_artifact",
  name: "security-audit-auth-2024.md",
  content: "# Security Audit: Auth Module\n\n## Findings\n...\n## Remediation\n...",
  description: "Security audit findings and remediation plan for auth module",
  tags: ["security", "audit", "auth"],
});
```

## Delegation

```typescript
// Full security audit
sessions_spawn({
  task: "Complete security audit of src/auth/ module. Check OWASP Top 10, review auth flows, session management, and token handling.",
  agentId: "security-engineer",
  model: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",
  label: "Auth Security Audit",
});

// Quick vulnerability scan
sessions_spawn({
  task: "Quick vulnerability scan of the API endpoints. Focus on injection and auth bypass.",
  agentId: "security-engineer",
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
  label: "API Vuln Scan",
});
