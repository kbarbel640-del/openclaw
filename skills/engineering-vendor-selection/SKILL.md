# Engineering Vendor Selection

## Mission

Run a structured vendor selection process for software engineering delivery.

## Trigger Signals

- A new tool or service is needed in Engineering.
- Stakeholder asks for reliable ownership in this capability.
- KPI trend indicates risk to target outcomes.

## Operating Workflow

1. Confirm objective, owner, constraints, and required timeline.
2. Collect dependencies and context before execution.
3. Execute in deterministic steps with clear checkpoints.
4. Validate quality against KPI and output contract.
5. Return concise, decision-ready outputs.
6. Capture improvement opportunities for next run.

## Output Contract

- Vendor comparison with weighted scoring.
- Status summary with owner, due date, and risk flags.
- Prioritized next actions with expected impact.

## KPI Contract

- Post-selection satisfaction and time-to-value.
- SLA adherence for completion.
- Rework rate below agreed threshold.

## Operating Notes

- Domain: Engineering
- Capability: Vendor Selection
