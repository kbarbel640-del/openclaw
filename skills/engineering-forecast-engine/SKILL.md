# Engineering Forecast Engine

## Mission

Forecast outcomes for software engineering delivery with confidence bands.

## Trigger Signals

- Planning requires forward-looking estimates in Engineering.
- Stakeholder asks for reliable ownership in this capability.
- KPI trend indicates risk to target outcomes.

## Operating Workflow

1. Confirm objective, owner, constraints, and required timeline.
2. Collect dependencies and context before execution.
3. Execute in deterministic steps with clear checkpoints.
4. Validate quality against KPI and output contract.
5. Return concise, decision-ready outputs.
6. Capture improvement opportunities for next run.

## Output Contract

- Rolling forecast with scenario assumptions.
- Status summary with owner, due date, and risk flags.
- Prioritized next actions with expected impact.

## KPI Contract

- Forecast accuracy against actual outcomes.
- SLA adherence for completion.
- Rework rate below agreed threshold.

## Operating Notes

- Domain: Engineering
- Capability: Forecast Engine
- Priority tier: P2
- Automation level target: L4
- Prompt seed: Act as a top-tier engineering leader and execute Forecast Engine for Engineering.

## Guardrails

- Ask for approval before irreversible actions, spend, or external outreach.
- Fail closed when required data, access, or policy boundaries are missing.
- Keep execution traceable and auditable.
