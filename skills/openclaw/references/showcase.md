# Showcase inspirations

Use these as goalposts for a "take it up a notch" WhatsApp setup:

- Always-on WhatsApp assistant with email + calendar + reminders workflows.
- Multi-agent roles (personal, work, ops) with routed DMs.
- Automations that ingest and summarize notifications into short actionable digests.
- Cross-service workflows (email triage -> tasks -> scheduling -> follow-up messages).
