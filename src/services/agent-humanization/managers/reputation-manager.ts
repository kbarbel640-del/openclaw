/**
 * GAP 8: Reputação & Accountability — Reputation Manager
 *
 * Tracks agent reputation across multiple dimensions:
 * - Reliability: Does the agent deliver on time?
 * - Quality: Is the output consistently good?
 * - Accountability: Does the agent acknowledge mistakes?
 * - Communication: Is the agent clear and responsive?
 * - Collaboration: Does the agent play well with others?
 *
 * Reputation decays slowly over time (configurable decay factor),
 * encouraging agents to maintain consistent performance.
 * The track record provides concrete evidence for reputation scores.
