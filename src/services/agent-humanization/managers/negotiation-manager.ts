/**
 * GAP 7: Conflito & Negociação — Negotiation Manager
 *
 * Provides assertiveness guidance for agents when they encounter
 * concerns about deadlines, scope, design, or resource conflicts.
 * Each concern has a recommended response based on severity:
 * - CRITICAL → Push back hard, escalate immediately
 * - HIGH → Express concern respectfully but firmly
 * - MEDIUM → Note concern, stay open to discussion
 * - LOW → Document for reference, don't block progress
 *
 * Also tracks conflict history to inform future negotiations.
