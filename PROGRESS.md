## Phase 1: Analysis & Benchmarking
- Status: In Progress
- Started: 2026-02-01

## Log
- 2026-02-01: Established baseline benchmarks. `openclaw help` takes ~5.1s, `status` ~9.5s, `--version` ~3.3s. Build system adds significant overhead (up to 30s total). Recorded in `docs/analysis/cli-bottlenecks/benchmarks.md`.
- 2026-02-01: Performed deep dive into CLI startup path. Identified `status` command and `tryRouteCli` as key bottlenecks. Updated analysis doc.
- 2026-02-01: Documented architectural plan for Lazy Command Registry in `docs/analysis/cli-bottlenecks.md`.
- 2026-02-01: Initialized tracking for CLI Bottlenecks mission.
- 2026-02-01: Implemented build-time optimizations in `scripts/run-node.mjs`: switched to recursive `fs.readdir` for faster change detection and added direct `tsgo` binary invocation to bypass `pnpm` overhead.
