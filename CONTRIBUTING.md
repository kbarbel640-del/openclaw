# Contributing to Money-maker-bot

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here's how to get started.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** this repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Branch naming: `feat/your-feature`, `fix/your-bug`, or `docs/your-docs`
3. Make your changes with clear, descriptive commits
4. **Test** your changes locally before opening a PR
5. Open a Pull Request — fill out the template and describe your changes

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ianalloway/Money-maker-bot
cd Money-maker-bot
npm install      # or: pip install -r requirements.txt
npm run dev      # or: python main.py
```

## Code Style

- **TypeScript/JS**: ESLint + Prettier (config in repo). Run `npm run lint` before committing.
- **Python**: Black + isort. Run `black . && isort .` before committing.
- Keep functions small and focused — one job per function.
- Write self-documenting code; add comments only where logic is non-obvious.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or bug fix per PR
- Include a clear description of **what** and **why**
- Reference related issues with `Closes #123`
- All CI checks must pass before merging
- Be responsive to review feedback
