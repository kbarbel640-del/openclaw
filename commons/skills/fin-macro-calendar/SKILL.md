# Macro Calendar & Regime Analyst

Economic calendar tracking, earnings dates, macro regime classification using the Ray Dalio framework, event impact analysis, and portfolio-aware event exposure mapping.

## When to Use

**USE this skill when:**

- "what's on the economic calendar this week"
- "when is the next Fed meeting" / "FOMC schedule"
- "macro regime" / "are we in stagflation"
- "how will CPI affect my portfolio"
- "earnings calendar" / "when does AAPL report"
- "what's the current macro environment"
- "yield curve" / "is the curve inverted"
- "cross-market impact of rate hikes"

## When NOT to Use

**DON'T use this skill when:**

- User wants asset-specific technical analysis -- use fin-expert
- User wants on-chain blockchain metrics -- use fin-onchain
- User wants to execute a trade -- use fin-trading
- User wants news headlines or sentiment -- use fin-news-intel
- User wants to backtest a strategy -- use fin-backtest

## Macro Regime Classification

### Ray Dalio Framework

Classify the current macroeconomic environment into one of four regimes:

| Regime | Growth | Inflation | Favored Assets | Hurt Assets |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Goldilocks** | Rising | Falling | Equities, Growth Tech, Crypto | Gold, Commodities |
| **Reflation** | Rising | Rising | Commodities, Value, TIPS, Real Assets | Long Bonds, Growth Tech |
| **Stagflation** | Falling | Rising | Gold, Cash, Commodities, Short Vol | Equities, Bonds, Crypto |
| **Deflation** | Falling | Falling | Long Bonds, Cash, Quality | Equities, Commodities, Crypto |

### Regime Input Indicators

Monitor these key indicators to determine the current regime:

| Indicator | Growth Signal | Inflation Signal |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| ISM PMI | >50 = expansion, <50 = contraction | Prices Paid sub-index |
| NFP (Nonfarm Payrolls) | >150K = healthy, <0 = recession risk | Wage growth YoY |
| GDP | >2% = solid, <0% = recession | GDP deflator |
| CPI | -- | >3% = hot, <2% = cool |
| Core PCE | -- | Fed's preferred gauge, target 2% |
| 2Y-10Y Spread | Inverted = recession warning | -- |
| VIX | <15 = complacency, >30 = fear | -- |
| DXY (Dollar Index) | Strong = tightening conditions | Weak = inflationary impulse |
| M2 Money Supply | Growing = expansionary | Rapid growth = inflationary |
| HY Spreads | <400bps = healthy, >600bps = stress | -- |

### Regime Transition Signals

Watch for these early indicators of regime change:

- PMI crossing 50 (expansion/contraction threshold)
- Yield curve slope change (steepening/flattening)
- CPI trend reversal (3-month moving average)
- Fed dot plot shifts vs market expectations
- Credit spread widening/tightening

## Event Impact Profiles

### FOMC Decision

| Scenario | Equities | Bonds | USD | Crypto | Gold |
|----------|----------|-------|-----|--------|------|
| Hawkish Surprise | -2 to -5% | -1 to -3% | +1 to +2% | -5 to -15% | -1 to -3% |
| Dovish Surprise | +2 to +5% | +1 to +3% | -1 to -2% | +5 to +15% | +1 to +3% |
| Inline | -0.5 to +0.5% | flat | flat | -1 to +1% | flat |

### CPI Release

| Scenario | Equities | Bonds | USD | Crypto | Gold |
|----------|----------|-------|-----|--------|------|
| Hot (>0.3% above consensus) | -1 to -3% | -1 to -2% | +0.5 to +1% | -3 to -8% | +0.5 to +1% |
| Cool (<0.2% below consensus) | +1 to +3% | +1 to +2% | -0.5 to -1% | +3 to +8% | -0.5 to +0.5% |
| Inline | -0.5 to +0.5% | flat | flat | -1 to +1% | flat |

### NFP (Nonfarm Payrolls)

| Scenario | Equities | Bonds | USD | Crypto |
|----------|----------|-------|-----|--------|
| Strong (>50K above consensus) | -1 to +1%* | -0.5 to -1.5% | +0.5 to +1% | -2 to -5% |
| Weak (<50K below consensus) | -1 to +1%* | +0.5 to +1.5% | -0.5 to -1% | +1 to +3% |
| Goldilocks (within 20K of consensus) | +0.5 to +1.5% | flat | flat | +1 to +3% |

*Equity reaction depends on regime: strong jobs in Goldilocks = positive; strong jobs in Reflation = negative (more hikes).

## Cross-Market Cascade Analysis

### Typical Transmission Chains

Map how one event propagates through markets:

**Fed Hike Cascade:**
Fed Hikes Rate -> Treasury Yields Rise -> USD Strengthens -> Risk Assets Fall -> EM Currencies Weaken -> Commodity Prices Fall -> EM Equities Fall

**Hot CPI Cascade:**
CPI Above Expectations -> Rate Hike Expectations Rise -> Bond Prices Fall -> Growth Stocks Sell Off -> Crypto Follows Risk-Off -> Gold Mixed (inflation hedge vs rate headwind)

**Geopolitical Shock Cascade:**
Conflict/Sanctions -> Oil Prices Spike -> Inflation Expectations Rise -> Flight to Safety (Bonds, Gold, USD) -> Risk Assets Fall -> Supply Chain Disruption Fears

### Portfolio Event Exposure

Cross-reference the user's holdings against upcoming events:

1. Identify which events affect which asset classes in the portfolio
2. Quantify exposure: what percentage of portfolio is sensitive to each event
3. Estimate range of outcomes using historical impact profiles
4. Suggest hedging considerations for high-exposure events

## Response Guidelines

- Start with the most immediately relevant events (today/this week) and their expected impact.
- For regime analysis, clearly state the current classification and confidence level. Show which indicators support and which contradict.
- Present event calendars in chronological table format with importance ratings.
- For event impact analysis, always show the historical average and range -- single-point estimates are misleading.
- When mapping events to portfolios, be specific: "Your 40% BTC allocation is sensitive to Thursday's CPI release. Historically, hot CPI prints have caused BTC to drop 3-8%."
- Highlight regime transition signals prominently -- these have the largest portfolio implications.
- Include the cross-market cascade chain for major events so users understand the transmission mechanism.
- Note the time of economic releases in the user's timezone when possible.

## Risk Disclosures

- Macro regime classification is a framework, not a prediction. Regimes can persist for years or shift rapidly.
- Historical event impact ranges are averages. Individual events can produce outlier moves far outside typical ranges.
- Cross-market cascade analysis describes typical transmission paths. Markets may react differently depending on positioning, liquidity, and concurrent events.
- Economic data is subject to revision. Initial releases may be significantly revised in subsequent months.
- This analysis is informational and does not constitute investment advice. Macro conditions are one of many factors affecting asset prices.
