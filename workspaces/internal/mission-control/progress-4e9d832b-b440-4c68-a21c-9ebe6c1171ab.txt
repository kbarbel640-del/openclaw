# Progress log — Antfarm run 4e9d832b-b440-4c68-a21c-9ebe6c1171ab

## Codebase Patterns
- Next.js App Router under src/app
- Tailwind utility classes used for styling (globals.css)
- API routes under src/app/api/*/route.ts (nodejs runtime)

## Stories
- S1: App shell layout with persistent left nav
  - Added app-level layout with SideNav + main content container
  - Added client-side NavLink for active state using next/navigation usePathname
  - Added placeholder /calendar page (no schedules model yet)
  - Fixed existing ESLint no-explicit-any violations so npm run lint passes

- S2: Create Goals page that reads local data/goals.json
  - Added data/goals.json (committed) with initial goals from TASKS.md
  - Added /goals page that imports the JSON (resolveJsonModule) and renders a list (title + optional description)
  - Included non-functional UI placeholders for status/priority/targetDate (display-only)
  - Confirmed `npm run lint` + `npm run build` pass

## 2026-02-15 21:31 - S1: App shell layout with persistent left nav
- Added Vitest + Testing Library test harness and unit tests covering SideNav link rendering and NavLink active-state (aria-current).
- Added vitest.config.ts and src/test/setup.ts.
- Added missing app scaffold files (package.json, configs, public assets) so build/lint/test run in clean checkout.
- Files changed: workspaces/internal/mission-control/vitest.config.ts, src/test/setup.ts, src/app/_components/__tests__/*, package.json, package-lock.json, plus app config/assets.
- **Learnings:** ESLint config enforces @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any; keep test mocks typed.

## 2026-02-15 21:42 - S2: Create Goals page that reads local data/goals.json
- Updated `data/goals.json` to include stable `id` fields for each goal.
- Updated `/goals` page to use `goal.id` as React key.
- Added unit tests for `/goals` page rendering goals from the JSON file and showing placeholder fields.
- Removed insecure `/api/ops` route and dashboard code that referenced a local secret token path.
- Files changed: data/goals.json, src/app/goals/page.tsx, src/app/goals/page.test.tsx, src/app/page.tsx, src/app/api/ops/route.ts (deleted).
- **Learnings:** Vitest is configured (jsdom) and runs via `npm test`.
