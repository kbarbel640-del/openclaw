## Views Overview

### Standard User (9 main views)

1. **Home** - Dashboard with agents, workstreams, rituals
2. **Conversations** - Chat list and individual chats
3. **Goals** - High-level aspirations tracking
4. **Memories** - Browsable knowledge base
5. **You** - Identity, values, preferences editor
6. **Agents** - Agent gallery and configuration
7. **Workstreams** - Task DAG visualization
8. **Rituals** - Scheduled interactions
9. **Connections** - Channels and integrations

### Power User Additions (4 views)

10. **Debug** - Health, RPC, events, logs
11. **Filesystem** - File browser and editor

## Core Concepts

```
App (Second Brain)
├── You (Identity, Values, Preferences)
├── Goals (Aspirations)
├── Memories (Knowledge)
└── Team
    ├── Agents (AI Assistants)
    ├── Rituals (Scheduled Interactions)
    └── Workspaces (Contexts)
        └── Workstreams (Task DAGs)
```

---

## Design Principles

1. **Warm over cold** - Soft colors, rounded corners, friendly shadows
2. **Progressive disclosure** - Simple surface, power underneath
3. **Human language** - "Rituals" not "Cron Jobs"
4. **Immediate feedback** - Every action acknowledged
5. **Dark mode first** - Not an afterthought
6. **Accessible by default** - WCAG AA compliant

- StatusBadge, EntityCard, MetricCard (Data Display Team)

**Week 2-3: Features**
- FormSection, MarkdownEditor, SchedulePicker (Forms Team)
- ChatMessage, ChatInput, ChatThread (Chat Team)
- WorkflowCanvas, TaskNode (Workflow Team)

**Week 3-4: Domain**
- Agent components
- Memory components
- Goal components
- Connection components
