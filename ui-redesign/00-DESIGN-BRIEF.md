# Second Brain Platform - Design Brief

## Project Overview

Complete UI redesign for a cloud-hosted AI agent management platform. The goal is to create a **human-centric "Second Brain"** experience that helps non-developers manage personalized AI assistants.

**Key Shift:** Moving from a developer-focused control panel to a warm, approachable platform for power users and small business owners.

## Target Personas

### Primary: Tech-Comfortable Power User
- Not a developer, but comfortable with technology
- Values: clean defaults, accessible depth, reliability indicators
- Wants: progressive disclosure (simple surface, power underneath)
- Examples: Marketing director with AI assistant, consultant managing client workflows

### Secondary: Small Business Owner
- Running AI to handle customer inquiries, scheduling, workflows
- Values: reliability, cost visibility, easy setup, clear status
- Wants: confidence that things are working, minimal learning curve

### Tertiary: Power User (Opt-in)
- Wants full control when needed
- Unlocks: raw config, terminal views, cron expressions, debug tools
- Toggle: "Enable Advanced Features" in settings

## Interaction Model

**Dashboard + Chat** with progressive disclosure:

### Standard User Experience
- **Home = Dashboard**: Agent health, recent activity, quick stats
- **Agent Cards**: Simple status indicators, one-click actions
- **Chat**: Full-featured conversational interface
- **Guided Wizards**: For setup and configuration
- **Visual Editors**: Personality sliders, preset templates

### Power User Mode (Opt-in Toggle)
Unlocks:
- Multi-pane workspace layouts
- Raw config editing (YAML/JSON)
- Filesystem browser + terminal view
- Memory architecture explorer
- Advanced automation builder (cron, webhooks)
- Debug console and event streams
- Custom theming and layout persistence
